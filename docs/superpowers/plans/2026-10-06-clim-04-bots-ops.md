# clim 04: Shared Package, Bots and Ops Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

> **Where commands run:** every command in this plan runs from the repository root, `/Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim`, unless it starts with its own `cd` (`cd shared && ...`, `cd bots && ...`). Launch Claude Code with that folder as its working directory, or prefix each command with `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && `: agent shells reset to the launch folder between calls.

**Goal:** Build `shared/`, the single TypeScript source of truth (units, the fee formula mirror, price math, the CRE report encoding, ABIs, deployments and parameters), and `bots/` (arbitrageur, retail flow, CRE run recorder around plan 02's simulation loop, replay server, funding, status and forged-report scripts), plus the run-book that starts everything on Ethereum Sepolia.

**Architecture:** A root Bun workspace holds `shared` and `bots`. `shared/src` is runtime-agnostic TypeScript (no Bun or Node API), so the CRE workflow can import it and plan 05's standalone app can port it against the same test vectors; the JSON files in `shared/` (deployments, params, ABIs) are read through validated, typed loaders. Every piece of logic in `bots/` is a pure, unit-tested function in `bots/src/lib/` or `bots/src/replay/`; the entry points (`arb.ts`, `noise.ts`, `sim-loop.ts`, `replay-server.ts`, `scripts/*.ts`) only wire those functions to viem clients, child processes and HTTP.

**Tech Stack:** Bun 1.3.9 (the version plan 02 pins; this plan's tests and typecheck also pass under 1.4.2: runtime, `bun test`, workspaces, `Bun.serve`, `Bun.spawn`), TypeScript 5.9.3 (`tsc --noEmit`), viem ^2.57.3, Foundry `cast` (ops), Chainlink CRE CLI (through plan 02's `cre/scripts/sim-loop.sh`).

---

## Decisions this plan makes

- **Runtime: Bun, not node/tsx.** The CRE TypeScript SDK already requires Bun (`@chainlink/cre-sdk` 1.23.0 declares `engines.bun >= 1.2.21`; the CRE templates use `bun install` and `bun test`), so Bun is installed anyway. Bun runs TypeScript without a build step and ships the test runner (`bun:test`), the HTTP server (`Bun.serve`, replay server), process spawning (`Bun.spawn`, CRE loop) and `.env` loading. One runtime for `cre/` and `bots/`, no extra tooling.
- **Workspace:** root `package.json` with Bun workspaces and `bunfig.toml` `linker = "hoisted"` (classic `node_modules`). The `workspaces` array grows as packages appear: `shared` (Task 1), then `bots` (Task 7). Bun refuses to install when a listed workspace folder does not exist (`error: Workspace not found "bots"`), so a folder is listed only once it exists. `cre/` and `app/` are **not** workspace members (the CRE CLI expects its own `node_modules` in the workflow folder; plan 05 deploys `app/` on its own).
- **`shared/src` stays runtime-agnostic.** Only `shared/test` and `shared/scripts` may use Bun or Node APIs.
- **Aligned with the sibling plans (01, 02, 05, 06 were written in parallel; this plan follows what they produce or request):**
  - `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` has exactly the layout plan 01's `05_WriteDeployments` writes and plan 05's app parses: token objects `tokens.tETH/tUSD`, `riskDesks.live/replay/don`, `hooks.live/replay`, `pools.*`, one token pair for both pairs (plan 01 keeps the PoolKeys distinct with different static fees, and updates spec 3.7). Plan 01's extra keys (`deployer`, `liquidity`) are ignored. Plan 02's `sync-config.ts` reads other key names and says to change its `KEYS` constant only: it must read `tokens.tETH.address`, `tokens.tUSD.address`, `riskDesks.live`, `riskDesks.replay`, `riskDesks.don`;
  - `routers.arb` (plan 05's request): the arbitrage bot swaps through its own PoolSwapTest, so the dashboard can tell arbitrage from retail swaps by `Swap.sender`. Plan 01's `00_Tokens` deploys it and `05_WriteDeployments` records it; if it is ever null the bot falls back to the shared PoolSwapTest and says so;
  - the CRE loop is plan 02's `cre/scripts/sim-loop.sh` (it builds the WASM once and simulates every 30 s with `--wasm`); `bun run cre-loop` (file `bots/src/sim-loop.ts`) runs it, records every run on-chain and writes per-run transcripts to `bots/out/cre-sim/` (plan 06's evidence input) instead of writing a second loop;
  - the replay server serves plan 02's replay contract, `GET /venue/<venue>/api/v3/klines` (Binance 1m klines with timestamps shifted to the wall clock, one path per venue), plus the Binance ticker for the replay arbitrageur, historical klines and a diagnostic `GET /snapshot`;
  - package scripts (canonical for every plan): `cre-loop`, `arb`, `noise`, `forge-report`, `fund`, `status`, `replay-server`;
  - retail flow is mirrored to both pools by default (spec 3.8); `split` and `cheapest` are variants;
  - the app stays a standalone npm project (plan 05 declined the workspace), so the root workspace holds only `shared` and `bots`; the fee mirror vectors below are what plan 05's port is checked against;
  - the fee mirror follows the spec's hook algorithm (`seq == 0`, `age = max(now - tObs, 0)`), which is equivalent to plan 01's `tObs == 0 || block.timestamp > tObs + tauKillSec`.
- **One key per bot and pair** (`ARB_LIVE`, `NOISE_LIVE`, `ARB_REPLAY`, `NOISE_REPLAY`) so concurrent processes never share a nonce. Plan 01 uses one key as deployer, TestToken owner and the live desk's `simOperator` (= `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` of `cre/.env`), so `fund` runs while the live CRE loop is stopped. The replay desk has its own operator key (`cre/.env.replay`, plan 01 Task 18): `ENV_FILE=.env.replay bun run cre-loop --pair replay` passes it to plan 02's loop script (`sim-loop.ts` spawns the script with `process.env`).
- **Arbitrage band is exact:** a v4 fee is taken from the input, so the no-arbitrage band is `[m(1-f), m/(1-f)]` (log half-width `gamma = -ln(1-f)`, as in spec 3.8) and the bot pushes the pool to the nearest edge.
- **`.gitignore`:** the existing `out/` rule also ignores `lab/out/` (`git check-ignore -v lab/out/x.json` prints `.gitignore:10:out/`), which the app reads and must be committed. It becomes `app/out/`, plus a `bots/out/*` block that keeps the two evidence files tracked (`!bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl`, `!bots/out/security-demos.jsonl`): the same block plan 06 Task 1 expects; plan 06 links them from `docs/evidence/README.md`.
- **Logging:** session-log bullets go under a `## Build notes` heading at the end of today's log (`docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` on day 1, `docs/sessions/2026-10-07.md` on day 2; create the heading once if missing), prefixed `(ops)`, as plan 02 does with `(CRE)`. New friction-log rows take the next free number.

## Contracts with other plans (they must use exactly these)

1. **`shared/deployments/sepolia.json`** (written by plan 01's `05_WriteDeployments`; validated by `parseDeployments`, Task 6):
   - `chainId` 11155111; `deployBlock` number or null; `uniswap.{poolManager,stateView,poolSwapTest,poolModifyLiquidityTest}`; `cre.{mockForwarder,keystoneForwarder}`;
   - `tokens.tETH` / `tokens.tUSD`: `{ address, symbol, decimals }` or null (one pair for the live and the replay pools);
   - `riskDesks.{live,replay,don}`, `hooks.{live,replay}`: address or null (`don` may be absent);
   - `pools.{liveV,liveS,replayV,replayS}`: `{ key: { currency0, currency1, fee, tickSpacing, hooks }, poolId, token0IsEth }` or null, where `poolId = keccak256(abi.encode(key))`, the currencies are tETH and tUSD sorted (`currency0 < currency1`), `token0IsEth == (currency0 == tETH)`, V pools have `fee = 8388608` (0x800000) and `hooks = hooks.<pair>`, S pools have a static fee and `hooks = 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`;
   - `routers.arb`: address or null (may be absent): a second PoolSwapTest (`new PoolSwapTest(IPoolManager(poolManager))`, v4-core `src/test/PoolSwapTest.sol`) that only the arbitrage bot uses. **Plan 01's `00_Tokens` deploys it and `05_WriteDeployments` writes this key** (plan 05's request); `arbRouter(d)` falls back to `uniswap.poolSwapTest` while it is null;
   - other keys (plan 01's `deployer`, `liquidity`) are ignored.
2. **`shared/params.json`** (written by the lab decision, plan 03, spec 2.6): `pStar, etaE4, sqrtHalfDtE6, feeMinPips, feeMaxPips, feeSafePips, tauKillSec, decidedBy` are read here; the lab also writes `staticFeePips`, `replayStaticFeePips` (plan 01's S pools) and `decidedAt`, which `parseParams` ignores. `parseParams` enforces `|etaE4 - round((1/pStar - 0.824) * 1e4)| <= 1` and `0 < feeMinPips <= feeSafePips <= feeMaxPips <= 1,000,000` (the hook constructor's bounds). This plan commits a bootstrap file whose `decidedBy` starts with `PROVISIONAL`; plan 01's hook deploy script must refuse to deploy while it does (helper `isProvisional`, which also flags a `FIXTURE` prefix, as the master plan requires). Both hooks (live and replay) are deployed from the same `params.json`, since `status.ts` checks either pair against it.
3. **Fee formula mirror** (`feePips`, `quoteFeeMirror` in `shared/src/units.ts`) = spec 3.6. Shared test vectors (sqrtHalfDtE6 2,449,490, kE4 10,000), to be reused by plan 01's Foundry tests: 48 %/yr = sigmaE9 85,475 with etaE4 91,761 gives **1,922 pips** (unrounded 1,921.2: the "1,921" quoted in the design brief is not the ceiling); 25 %/yr = 44,518 gives 1,001; 100 %/yr = 178,072 gives 1,822 (P\* 20 %, etaE4 41,760) and 1,095 (P\* 30 %, etaE4 25,093); 225 %/yr = 400,663 gives 4,099 and 2,463; 46 %/yr = 81,913 at P\* 30 % gives 504; SIGMA_MAX 1,780,730 at P\* 20 % gives raw 18,216, capped to 15,000; k = 2.0 at 100 %/yr, P\* 30 % gives 2,190; an exact product (10,000 x 10,000 x 1,000,000 x 10,000) gives 10 and one more unit of sigma gives 11. Annual sigma to sigmaE9 rounds to nearest (100 %/yr is 178,072, not 178,073). `status.ts` compares the deployed hook's `quoteFee()` with the mirror on every block.
4. **TestToken** (plan 01): ERC-20, 18 decimals, `mint(address to, uint256 amount)` callable only by the deployer (`onlyOwner`), plus a public `faucet()` (10 tETH or 25,000 tUSD per address per hour) that plan 05's `/swap` and `/lp` pages use; `fund.ts` mints from the deployer key.
5. **ABIs:** plan 01 Task 14's `contracts/script/export-abis.sh` is the only exporter: it writes bare ABI arrays to `shared/abis/` for RiskDesk, IRiskDesk, ClimHook, TestToken, IPoolManager, IStateView, PoolSwapTest and PoolModifyLiquidityTest, including the three this package checks (RiskDesk, ClimHook, TestToken); `shared/test/abis.test.ts` then fails if the hand-written fragments drift from the compiled contracts. (Task 5's `shared/scripts/export-abis.ts`, a three-contract subset, and its `export-abis` script were removed on 2026-10-07, commit `5ed36a8`.)
6. **CRE loop and log lines (plan 02), transcripts (plan 06):** `cre/scripts/sim-loop.sh <staging-settings|replay-settings> --broadcast`, run from `cre/`, prints `=== <UTC time>` before each run and the workflow's `[USER LOG]` lines plus any line containing `rror` and the CLI's failure lines marked `✗` (for example `✗ Credential validation failed`). `bots/src/lib/simParse.ts` reads the workflow's final lines: `REPORT applied ... tx=0x..`, `REPORT sent, desk state unreadable after tx=0x..`, `NOT APPLIED: ... tx=0x..`, `REJECTED by RiskDesk (onReport reverted) tx=0x..`, `clim: no report (<reason>)`, `DRY RUN: ...`. The CRE template's `Write report transaction succeeded: 0x..` comes before the final line, so it is kept in the transcript but does not end the run; when the simulator loses the final line, the run keeps that line's tx. For a run with a tx the receipt decides `applied`: the forwarder's `ReportProcessed.result` true and a `RiskReported` from the desk in that tx (`statusFromReceipt: true` when this overrides the workflow's line, which stays in `detail`). If plan 02 changes these words, change `RULES` in `simParse.ts` and its test in the same commit. `bun run cre-loop` writes each run's transcript (from its `===` line to its last line, which carries `tx=0x...`) to `bots/out/cre-sim/<pair>-<run start>.log`: the "one file per `cre workflow simulate` run" that plan 06's evidence collector reads (they hold the loop's filtered stdout; the complete CLI output is in plan 02's `cre/logs/`).
7. **Replay (plans 02 and 03):** plan 03 writes `lab/out/replay-window.json` = `{ symbol: "ETHUSDT", source, startTs, stepSec: 1, warmupSec, closes }`: `startTs` on a minute boundary, `warmupSec` a multiple of 60 and >= 1260 (use 1800: 2026-02-04 11:30 to 16:00 UTC, 16,200 closes, about 128 KB, no gap in `lab/data/b1s_feb.csv`), one close per second, forward-filled, length a multiple of 60. The server maps the main start (12:00 UTC) to the wall-clock minute it starts on and then runs at 1x. **Plan 02's replay mode reads `GET /venue/<venue>/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1m&limit=20`** (one call per configured venue): Binance 1m klines whose open and close times are shifted to the wall clock (`+offsetSec`, a multiple of 60), so the workflow's freshness rule works with DON time. Every venue path returns the same series, so the quorum is met by construction, dispersion is 0 and `dvolE2 = 0`; the replay desk's REPLAY flag discloses it. The plan 00 integration check ran this route through plan 02's parser and estimator: all 479 replay reports from 12:00:30 reproduce the lab's `points[].rv15E9` exactly. `GET /api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=ETHUSDT` gives the replay arbitrageur its market price; `GET /api/v3/klines` (historical times) and `GET /snapshot` (`{ nowSec, usdtUsd: 1, dvol: null, venues: [binance-replay-1..4] }` in historical time) are diagnostics.
8. **Importing `shared/` from `cre/`:** `shared/src/units.ts` has no dependency and can be imported by relative path (`../../shared/src/units`); `shared/src/report.ts` imports viem, which Bun resolves from the root `node_modules` only after a root `bun install`. The desk's rounding rule is `sigmaE9 = Math.round(rv15PerSqrtSecond * 1e9)`.
9. **App (plan 05):** standalone npm project, outside the workspace. It copies `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, `shared/params.json` and `shared/abis/*.json` with its sync script and ports the fee helpers, checked against the vectors of contract 3. It identifies arbitrage swaps by `Swap.sender == routers.arb` and recovers the arbitrageur's market price from the post-swap price, which relies on this plan's band edges `[m(1 - f), m/(1 - f)]`.
10. **Pool depth and start price (plan 01):** seed V and S with the same full-range liquidity, about 100,000 tETH + 271,000,000 tUSD at 2,713 (L of about 5.2e24 for 18/18 tokens; plan 01's fork run measured 5.2086e24); same for the replay pools at the window's start price (about 2,255). At that depth a $2,000 retail order moves the price about 0.15 bp (measured 0.147 bp on a fork), well under the per-block volatility (about 3 bp at 50 %/yr), so retail flow does not drive the arbitrage frequency. The first plan had 10,000 tETH (L about 5.2e23), where a $2,000 order moved the price about 1.5 bp (measured 1.25 bp for $1,696) and 3 of the arbitrage bot's first 4 decisions on S hit `PriceLimitAlreadyExceeded`. Pools may start a little off the market: the arbitrageur aligns them on its first block. A visitor's `/lp` deposit (plan 05, a few tETH from the faucet) changes one pool's L by about 0.01 %, so V and S stay twins.

## Verified facts (how)

- Sepolia bytecode present (`cast code <addr> --rpc-url https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com | wc -c`) at PoolManager `0xE03A1074c86CFeDd5C142C4F04F1a1536e203543`, StateView `0xE1Dd9c3fA50EDB962E442f60DfBc432e24537E4C`, PoolSwapTest `0x9B6b46e2c869aa39918Db7f52f5557FE577B6eEe`, PoolModifyLiquidityTest `0x0C478023803a644c94c4CE1C1e7b9A087e411B0A`, MockKeystoneForwarder `0x15fC6ae953E024d975e77382eEeC56A9101f9F88`, KeystoneForwarder `0xF8344CFd5c43616a4366C34E3EEE75af79a74482`, Multicall3 `0xcA11bde05977b3631167028862bE2a173976CA11`. `StateView.poolManager()`, `PoolSwapTest.manager()` and `PoolModifyLiquidityTest.manager()` all return the PoolManager above. Selectors `0x2229d0b4` (PoolSwapTest.swap) and `0xc815641c` (StateView.getSlot0) are in the deployed bytecode.
- `PoolSwapTest.swap(PoolKey, SwapParams{zeroForOne, amountSpecified, sqrtPriceLimitX96}, TestSettings{takeClaims, settleUsingBurn}, bytes)` and its settlement (`transferFrom(msg.sender, manager, amount)`, so approve PoolSwapTest) read in `Uniswap/v4-core` `src/test/PoolSwapTest.sol` and `test/utils/CurrencySettler.sol`; a negative `amountSpecified` is exact input; `Pool.swap` reverts `PriceLimitAlreadyExceeded` unless the limit is strictly beyond the current price in the swap direction.
- MockKeystoneForwarder source (Sourcify, verified): `report()` is permissionless, slices `rawReport[45:109]` as metadata and `rawReport[109:]` as the report, calls `onReport` through `route()`, emits `ReportProcessed(receiver, executionId, reportId, result)` and does not revert when the receiver reverts.
- Spec Appendix B question 1 answered on-chain: `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` sends `report()` from the `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` account straight to the mock forwarder, so `tx.origin` is the operator and the RiskDesk SIM guard works. While planning this was read on another project's tx, `0xe57a006e7585984137cb5064d6be6fc7b9353194760178b85a78274c8785fa2c` (from the EOA `0x7277EDa336023Fe93142153a5bba4C770C1E6689`, not ours; block 11,855,382, before clim's deploy block 11,856,974; selector `0x11289565`, gas used 185,913). Confirmed on our own desk (checked with `cast tx` and `cast receipt` on 2026-10-07): clim's first report, tx `0x6046552302b7711c4987ee7706d957538dc11ee77ca557b18c92261154e21cb6` (block 11,857,019, selector `0x11289565`, gas used 272,704), goes from our operator `0x53aB240f6cffC204FC22ac6722D9632d753a5A82`, the `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` account and the live desk's `simOperator`, to the mock, which logs the desk's `RiskReported` (seq 1) and `ReportProcessed` with result true. Its metadata carries placeholders (workflowCid `0x11...11`, workflowName 10 bytes, owner `0xaa...aa`, header timestamp 100), which is why the spec keeps the workflow-identity checks off in simulation.
- All the code below was typechecked (`tsc --noEmit`) and unit-tested (`bun test`: shared 55 pass and 3 skip, bots 57 pass) under Bun 1.4.2 and viem 2.57.3. After the plan 00 integration changes (simParse outcome rules, wall-clock venue klines) the suite is shared 55 pass and 3 skip, bots 60 pass, re-run under both Bun 1.3.9 and 1.4.2. After the 2026-10-07 receipt classification fix (Tasks 16 and 17): bots 66 pass, simParse 15, under Bun 1.3.9. On 2026-10-07, with the committed `shared/abis/*.json` (so the drift checks run) and without the removed export script: shared 58 pass, 0 skip; bots 66 pass (Bun 1.3.9). End to end on an anvil fork of Sepolia (real PoolManager, StateView, PoolSwapTest and MockKeystoneForwarder; stub tokens, a stub desk with the `tx.origin` guard and a stub override-fee hook installed at an address carrying the afterInitialize and beforeSwap flags; both token orders tried): `fund` minted and approved (arbitrage key on a second PoolSwapTest installed as `routers.arb`, retail key on the shared one; replay keys skipped), `status` read both pools and the 4-venue median, exited 0 when the hook matched the mirror and 1 with a `PROBLEM` line when it did not; `arb` moved each pool exactly to the band edge `m(1 - f)` on its first block (fees of 5 bp and 30 bp tried), printed `none` inside the band, and its swaps carried `Swap.sender = routers.arb`; `noise` mirrored each order to V and S; a stub-desk report sent by the operator through the mock was applied while `forge-report` was rejected (`forwarder result=false`, desk unchanged); `cre-loop` (driving a stand-in for plan 02's script) recorded `applied` (with the decoded `RiskReported`, `forwarderResult true`), `no-report` and `error` runs with one transcript file each, and `--once` stopped after the first. The replay server served the real February window: `/snapshot` gave four venues of 25 closed candles with `nowSec` inside the window.
- Public venue endpoints answered from Singapore: Coinbase Advanced product `price`, Kraken `Ticker?pair=ETHUSD,USDTUSD` (`result.XETHZUSD.c[0]`, `result.USDTZUSD.c[0]`), Binance `data-api.binance.vision` ticker (USDT), Hyperliquid `allMids` (`ETH`).

### Task 1: Root Bun workspace and .gitignore

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** nothing

**Files:**
- Create: `package.json`, `bunfig.toml`
- Modify: `.gitignore`

- [x] **Step 1: Install Bun if missing**

Run: `bun --version 2>/dev/null || { curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.3.9" && ln -sf "$HOME/.bun/bin/bun" /opt/homebrew/bin/bun && ln -sf "$HOME/.bun/bin/bun" /opt/homebrew/bin/bunx; }; bun --version`
Expected: `1.3.9` (plan 02 Task 1 installs it the same way; `1.4.2` also passes this plan's tests). The installer only edits `~/.zshrc`, which Claude Code's Bash tool does not re-read, so the binary is linked into `/opt/homebrew/bin` (on PATH, writable without sudo); never rely on `export PATH=...`, which does not survive to the next command.

- [x] **Step 2: Create the root `package.json`**

Only `shared` for now: Bun refuses to install when a listed workspace folder does not exist (`error: Workspace not found "bots"`). Task 7 adds `bots`; `app` stays outside the workspace (plan 05 is a standalone npm project).

```json
{
  "name": "clim",
  "private": true,
  "license": "MIT",
  "workspaces": ["shared"],
  "scripts": {
    "test": "bun run --filter '*' test",
    "typecheck": "bun run --filter '*' typecheck"
  }
}
```

- [x] **Step 3: Create `bunfig.toml`**

```toml
[install]
linker = "hoisted"
```

- [x] **Step 4: Fix `.gitignore`**

In the `# Node / Next / Bun` block replace the line `out/` with `app/out/`, and insert this block right before the `# OS` line (plan 06 Task 1 expects exactly these lines and adds its own `docs/submission/out/`; if it ran first, only check that they exist):

```
node_modules/
.next/
app/out/
dist/
*.tsbuildinfo
```

```
# Bots: run logs stay local, except the CRE run log and the security demo records (submission evidence)
bots/out/*
!bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl
!bots/out/security-demos.jsonl

```

- [x] **Step 5: Verify the ignore rules**

Run:
```bash
mkdir -p lab/out bots/out/tmp && touch lab/out/.probe bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl bots/out/arb-live.jsonl bots/out/tmp/x.log
git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all lab/out bots/out
rm -rf lab/out/.probe bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl bots/out/arb-live.jsonl bots/out/tmp
```
Expected exactly (`cre-runs.jsonl` is tracked on purpose, `arb-live.jsonl` and `tmp/` are ignored):
```
?? bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl
?? lab/out/.probe
```

- [x] **Step 6: Log the decision**

Append under `## Build notes` at the end of today's session log (`docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` on day 1, `docs/sessions/2026-10-07.md` on day 2; add the heading if it is missing):

```markdown
- (ops) Tooling: Bun workspaces at the root (`shared`, `bots`; `app` stays a standalone npm project, plan 05) with the hoisted linker. The bots run on Bun because the CRE TypeScript SDK already requires Bun >= 1.2.21. `.gitignore`: `out/` narrowed to `app/out/` (it also ignored `lab/out/`, which the app reads); `bots/out/*` ignored except `cre-runs.jsonl` and `security-demos.jsonl` (submission evidence).
```

- [x] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add package.json bunfig.toml .gitignore docs/sessions/
git commit -m "build: add root Bun workspace and track lab/out"
```

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 2

**Files:**
- Create: `shared/src/abis.ts`

Built with a `shared/scripts/export-abis.ts` (commit `8dfd1cf`) that copied three of the ABIs; it was removed on 2026-10-07 (commit `5ed36a8`) because plan 01 Task 14's `contracts/script/export-abis.sh` writes the same files and five more, and is the only exporter now.

Run: `cd shared && bun test test/abis.test.ts && bun run typecheck`
Expected: ` 3 pass`, ` 3 skip`, ` 0 fail` (the three skips are the drift checks, waiting for `shared/abis/*.json`); typecheck clean.

When plan 01 has compiled the contracts: `contracts/script/export-abis.sh` (plan 01 Task 14; it runs `forge build` itself) prints the eight `../shared/abis/<Name>.json` paths it wrote, and the same test then shows ` 6 pass`, ` 0 skip` (checked on 2026-10-07 with the committed ABIs). A failing drift check means the contract and the canonical interface disagree: fix the side that deviates from the canonical interface in the master plan, never silence the test.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add shared/src/abis.ts shared/test/abis.test.ts
git commit -m "feat(shared): typed ABI fragments"
```
(Committed as `8dfd1cf` "feat(shared): typed ABI fragments and ABI export script", with the export script removed since.)

### Task 6: Deployments and params schemas with validated loaders

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 3, 5

**Files:**
- Create: `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, `shared/params.json`, `shared/src/config.ts`, `shared/src/index.ts`
- Test: `shared/test/config.test.ts`

- [x] **Step 1: Create the data files**

`shared/deployments/sepolia.json` (Uniswap infrastructure and CRE forwarders verified on-chain; everything plan 01 deploys starts as `null`; if plan 01's `05_WriteDeployments` already wrote this file, keep it):
```json
{
  "chainId": 11155111,
  "deployBlock": null,
  "uniswap": {
    "poolManager": "0xE03A1074c86CFeDd5C142C4F04F1a1536e203543",
    "stateView": "0xE1Dd9c3fA50EDB962E442f60DfBc432e24537E4C",
    "poolSwapTest": "0x9B6b46e2c869aa39918Db7f52f5557FE577B6eEe",
    "poolModifyLiquidityTest": "0x0C478023803a644c94c4CE1C1e7b9A087e411B0A"
  },
  "cre": {
    "mockForwarder": "0x15fC6ae953E024d975e77382eEeC56A9101f9F88",
    "keystoneForwarder": "0xF8344CFd5c43616a4366C34E3EEE75af79a74482"
  },
  "tokens": { "tETH": null, "tUSD": null },
  "riskDesks": { "live": null, "replay": null, "don": null },
  "hooks": { "live": null, "replay": null },
  "pools": { "liveV": null, "liveS": null, "replayV": null, "replayS": null },
  "routers": { "arb": null }
}
```

`shared/params.json` (skip this file if the lab, plan 03, has already written it):
```json
{
  "pStar": 0.3,
  "etaE4": 25093,
  "sqrtHalfDtE6": 2449490,
  "feeMinPips": 500,
  "feeMaxPips": 15000,
  "feeSafePips": 3000,
  "tauKillSec": 180,
  "decidedBy": "PROVISIONAL (plan 04 bootstrap): replace with the lab decision (plan 03) before deploying the hook"
}
```

- [x] **Step 2: Write the failing test**

The pool id vector comes from `cast keccak $(cast abi-encode "f(address,address,uint24,int24,address)" 0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222 8388608 60 0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333)`.

### Task 7: `bots` package, env and log helpers

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 6

**Files:**
- Modify: `package.json` (workspaces)
- Create: `bots/package.json`, `bots/tsconfig.json`, `bots/src/lib/env.ts`, `bots/src/lib/jsonl.ts`
- Test: `bots/test/env.test.ts`

- [x] **Step 1: Register the workspace and create the package**

In the root `package.json`, change `"workspaces": ["shared"]` to `"workspaces": ["shared", "bots"]` (keep `"app"` if plan 05 already added it).

`bots/package.json`:
```json

    expect(() => botKey("ARB", "live", { ARB_LIVE_PRIVATE_KEY: "1234" })).toThrow(/0x/);
  });
  test("envNum parses numbers with a fallback", () => {

### Task 14: Arbitrage bot

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 10, 11, 13

**Files:**
- Create: `bots/src/arb.ts`

Behaviour: on each new block (polled every 2 s; missed blocks are not replayed; a block that arrives while the previous one is still being handled is skipped), read V and S (`slot0`), the hook fee, the desk, the bot balances and the market price (live: median of the four venues; replay: the replay server's ticker); decide for each pool; outside the band, simulate then send an exact-input swap through `arbRouter(d)` (`routers.arb`, or the shared PoolSwapTest with a warning until plan 01 deploys it) spending up to the whole balance with the band-edge price limit (the swap stops at the limit). A pool with a pending arbitrage is skipped. `PriceLimitAlreadyExceeded` (0x7c9c6e8f) in simulation is logged as `stale`: another swap moved the pool after the read, and nothing was sent.

- [x] **Step 1: Implementation**

`bots/src/arb.ts`:
```ts
// Arbitrage bot: every new block, read both pools and the market price, and arbitrage each pool back to
// the edge of its no-arbitrage band (V: fee from ClimHook.quoteFee(), S: static fee from slot0.lpFee).
// It swaps through routers.arb (its own PoolSwapTest, so the app can tell arbitrage swaps by Swap.sender).

### Task 17: CRE simulation loop with an on-chain record of every run

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 13, 16; plan 02 Task 9 (`cre/scripts/sim-loop.sh`)

**Files:**
- Create: `bots/src/sim-loop.ts`
- Modify: `docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md`, today's session log

Behaviour (`bun run cre-loop`): start plan 02's `bash scripts/sim-loop.sh <target> --broadcast` in `cre/` (target `staging-settings` for `--pair live`, `replay-settings` for `--pair replay`, or `--target`), echo its output, cut it into runs with `RunTracker`, write each run's transcript to `bots/out/cre-sim/<pair>-<run start>.log`, and append one JSON line per run to `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl`: `status` (`applied`, `sent`, `not-applied`, `rejected`, `no-report`, `dry-run`, `error`, `no-outcome`), `detail`, and for runs with a transaction the receipt (`txStatus`, `blockNumber`, `gasUsed`, `from`), the MockKeystoneForwarder `ReportProcessed.result` (`forwarderResult`) and the decoded `RiskReported` fields. The receipt is the ground truth: `forwarderResult` true and a `RiskReported` from the desk make the run `applied` whatever the workflow printed (its read-back of `RiskDesk.state()` at `latest` can hit a lagging RPC node, and the simulator can lose its final line), with `statusFromReceipt: true` when that overrides the workflow's line; never `applied` without both facts. A CRE CLI credential failure is recorded as `error` with `detail` `CRE CLI credential validation failed`, a run that printed nothing as `no-outcome` with `detail` `no output`. `--once` stops after the first run. Ctrl-C stops the loop too.

- [x] **Step 1: Implementation**

`bots/src/sim-loop.ts`:
```ts
// CRE simulation loop with an on-chain record of every run.
// Runs plan 02's loop (`cre/scripts/sim-loop.sh <target> --broadcast`: build the WASM once, then
// `cre workflow simulate --wasm ... --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --broadcast` every 30 s) and echoes its output.
// For each run it writes the transcript to bots/out/cre-sim/<run start>.log (plan 06 evidence input) and appends one
// line to bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl: status, tx hash, receipt, the forwarder's ReportProcessed.result and the decoded
// RiskReported event. The receipt decides `applied` (receiptStatus); statusFromReceipt says when it overrode the
// workflow's final line, which stays in `detail`.
// Usage: bun src/sim-loop.ts --pair live|replay [--target <cre target>] [--once]

- [x] **Step 2: Typecheck and wiring check**

Run: `cd bots && bun run typecheck && bun run cre-loop --pair live --once`
Expected: typecheck clean; before plan 01 has deployed: `error: riskDesks.live is null: deploy it first (plan 01) and record it in shared/deployments/sepolia.json`. The real run is in Task 23.

- [x] **Step 3: Record what the research verified**

In `docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md`, in the row that starts with `| 1 |`, set the last cell to the following text if it still reads `design phase, to confirm`; if plan 01 Task 6 already wrote a status there, append `; ` and this text to it instead:
`confirmed on Sepolia: simulate --broadcast sends report() from the CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY account straight to the mock (our first report, tx 0x6046552302b7711c4987ee7706d957538dc11ee77ca557b18c92261154e21cb6, from our operator key 0x53aB240f6cffC204FC22ac6722D9632d753a5A82 to the mock), so a tx.origin guard works; bots/src/scripts/forge-report.ts demonstrates the guard on our desk`

Append under `## Build notes` in today's session log:

```markdown
- (ops) Spec Appendix B, question 1: yes. `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` sends `report()` from the `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` account directly to MockKeystoneForwarder (clim's first report, Sepolia tx 0x6046552302b7711c4987ee7706d957538dc11ee77ca557b18c92261154e21cb6, from our operator key 0x53aB240f6cffC204FC22ac6722D9632d753a5A82), so `tx.origin` is the operator. The same tx shows the simulation metadata placeholders (workflowCid 0x11...11, owner 0xaa...aa, header timestamp 100): keep RiskDesk's workflow-identity checks off in simulation.
- (ops) `bun run cre-loop` (`bots/src/sim-loop.ts`) runs plan 02's `cre/scripts/sim-loop.sh`, records each run (receipt, `ReportProcessed.result`, decoded `RiskReported`) in `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` and writes one transcript per run to `bots/out/cre-sim/` for plan 06's evidence collector.
```

Correction (2026-10-07): when this step ran, both texts cited tx `0xe57a006e7585984137cb5064d6be6fc7b9353194760178b85a78274c8785fa2c`, which is another project's transaction (sender `0x7277EDa336023Fe93142153a5bba4C770C1E6689`, mined at block 11,855,382, before clim's deploy block 11,856,974; checked with `cast tx`). Friction log row 1 and spec Appendix B now cite clim's first report as above; the 2026-10-06 session log keeps the old line, corrected in the 2026-10-07 log.

- [x] **Step 4: Commit**

### Task 19: Replay server

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 18

**Files:**

- [x] **Step 1: Implementation**

`bots/src/replay-server.ts`:
```ts
// Replay server: serves lab/out/replay-window.json at 1x real time.
//   GET /venue/<name>/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1m&limit=20   plan 02 replay mode (wall-clock times)
//   GET /api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=ETHUSDT   the replay price, read by the replay arbitrageur
//   GET /api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1m&limit=N[&startTime=ms][&endTime=ms]   Binance 1m klines (historical times)

    return Response.json(r.body, { status: r.status, headers: { "access-control-allow-origin": "*" } });
  },
});

const mainIso = new Date(clock.mainStartHist * 1000).toISOString();
console.log(`[replay] ${w.source}: ${w.closes.length} s from ${new Date(w.startTs * 1000).toISOString()}, main start ${mainIso}`);
console.log(`[replay] anchor ${new Date(anchor * 1000).toISOString()} (REPLAY_ANCHOR_SEC=${anchor}), offset ${clock.offsetSec} s`);
console.log(`[replay] listening on http://127.0.0.1:${port} (GET /venue/<name>/api/v3/klines, /api/v3/ticker/price, /api/v3/klines, /snapshot, /status)`);
```

- [x] **Step 2: Smoke test with a synthetic window**

Run (one shell; the server runs in the background and is stopped at the end):
```bash
cd bots && bun -e 'await Bun.write("/tmp/clim-replay-test.json", JSON.stringify({ symbol: "ETHUSDT", source: "synthetic", startTs: 1770204600, stepSec: 1, warmupSec: 1260, closes: Array.from({ length: 1800 }, (_, i) => 2000 + i * 0.5) }))'

curl -s localhost:18787/status; echo
curl -s localhost:18787/snapshot | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['nowSec'], [(v['venue'], len(v['candles'])) for v in d['venues']], d['venues'][0]['candles'][-1])"

curl -s "localhost:18787/venue/kraken/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1m&limit=1"; echo
pkill -f "src/replay-server.ts"
```
Expected, with s = the seconds elapsed in the current wall-clock minute (validated run: s = 53):
```
[replay] synthetic: 1800 s from 2026-02-04T11:30:00.000Z, main start 2026-02-04T11:51:00.000Z

```
(`histNow` and `nowSec` are 1770205860 + s; the kline's high and close are 2630 + 0.5 s. The last line is the same candle on the wall clock: `<anchor>` is the `REPLAY_ANCHOR_SEC` printed on the second line, which is what plan 02's replay mode reads.)

### Task 22: Run-book and environment template

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 14 to 21

**Files:**
- Create: `bots/.env.example`, `docs/runbook.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Environment template**

`bots/.env.example`:
```bash
# bots/.env (gitignored). Bun loads it automatically when commands run from bots/.
# Testnet keys only. Generate each key with `cast wallet new`.

# Sepolia RPC. A keyed endpoint (Alchemy, Infura) is more reliable than the public one under bot load.
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com

# Funds the bots with Sepolia ETH and mints test tokens: the plan 01 deployer key (TestToken owner).
# In plan 01 it is also the live desk's simOperator, i.e. the CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY of cre/.env (with 0x here).
# The replay desk has its own operator key in cre/.env.replay (plan 01 Task 18), used with ENV_FILE=.env.replay.
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=

```

- [x] **Step 2: Run-book**

`docs/runbook.md`:
````markdown
# clim run-book

How to run clim on Ethereum Sepolia: the Chainlink CRE risk desk loop, the arbitrage and retail bots, the February 2026 replay and the two security demos. Commands run from the repository root unless a `cd` is shown. Expected output follows each command; addresses, prices and hashes will differ.

## 0. One-time setup

### Tools
| Tool | Install | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Bun 1.3.9 (the CRE TypeScript SDK requires Bun; the bots use it too) | `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash -s "bun-v1.3.9"`, then `ln -sf "$HOME/.bun/bin/bun" /opt/homebrew/bin/bun` | `bun --version` |
| Foundry (contracts, `cast`) | `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz \| bash && foundryup` | `cast --version` |
| CRE CLI | `curl -sSL https://app.chain.link/cre/install.sh \| bash`, then `ln -sf "$HOME/.cre/bin/cre" /opt/homebrew/bin/cre` | `cre version` |
| CRE login (simulation needs it) | `cre login` (opens a browser) | `cre whoami` |
| tmux (optional, section 3) | `brew install tmux` | `tmux -V` |

```bash
bun install          # root: installs the shared/ and bots/ workspaces (hoisted, see bunfig.toml)
bun run test         # expected: every package "0 fail"
bun run typecheck    # expected: "@clim/shared typecheck: Exited with code 0", "@clim/bots typecheck: Exited with code 0"
```

### Keys
Generate each key with `cast wallet new`. Testnet keys only; never commit them.

| Role | Variable | File | Funded by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Deployer and live CRE operator (plan 01 uses one key: it deploys, owns TestToken, and is the live desk's `simOperator`) | `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` (0x + 64 hex) in `bots/.env`; the same key as `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` (64 hex, **no 0x**) in `cre/.env` | `bots/.env`, `cre/.env` | a Sepolia faucet |
| Replay CRE operator (the replay desk's `simOperator`) | `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` (64 hex, **no 0x**) in `cre/.env.replay`, created by plan 01 Task 18 | `cre/.env.replay` | 0.2 ETH from the deployer (plan 01 Task 18 Step 1) |
| Live arbitrageur and retail flow | `ARB_LIVE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `NOISE_LIVE_PRIVATE_KEY` | `bots/.env` | `bun run fund` |
| Replay arbitrageur and retail flow (same tETH/tUSD tokens, other pools) | `ARB_REPLAY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `NOISE_REPLAY_PRIVATE_KEY` | `bots/.env` | `bun run fund` |

Because the deployer is also the live CRE operator, run `bun run fund` before starting the live CRE loop or while it is stopped: two processes sending from one key collide on nonces. The replay loop sends from its own key and can keep running.

```bash
cp bots/.env.example bots/.env   # then fill the keys and SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Gas budget (Sepolia, gas price measured at about 1 gwei)
| Flow | Rate | Gas per tx | ETH per day |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRE reports (`report` through MockKeystoneForwarder) | 1 per 30 s = 2,880/day | 90k-190k | about 0.5 |
| Arbitrage (two pools) | about 0.2-0.3 trades per pool per 12 s block = about 3,600/day | 120k-150k | about 0.55 |
| Retail flow, mirrored to both pools | 0.5 orders per block x 2 pools = 7,200 swaps/day | 120k-150k | about 1.1 |
| **Live pair total** | | | **about 2.2 ETH/day** |

The replay (4 hours) costs about a sixth of that. If ETH is short, lower `NOISE_RATE_PER_BLOCK`; never stop the arbitrageur, it is what the measurement is about.

## 1. Check the deployment
Plan 01 fills `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, plan 03 writes `shared/params.json`. The shared tests validate both files (pool ids, token pairs and order, fee flags, parameters):

```bash
bun run --cwd shared test
cd bots && bun run status --pair live
```
Expected (exit code 0, no `PROBLEM` line):
```
pair live: hook 0x...1080 desk 0x...
params: P*=0.3 etaE4=25093 floor 500 cap 15000 safe 3000 tauKill 180s (lab/scripts/decide_pstar.py: year/aggregator LP P&L: ...)
block 11860000 | desk seq 12 age 25s sigma 32.0%/yr k 1 flags 0 | V fee 500 pips (5.00 bp, normal) | S fee 511 pips | V 2713.10 S 2713.50 | market 2713.80 (4 venues)
ARB_LIVE 0x...: 0.2 ETH, 1000000 tETH, 10000000000 tUSD, approved
NOISE_LIVE 0x...: 0.2 ETH, 1000000 tETH, 10000000000 tUSD, approved
```
- `error: pools.liveV is null: deploy it first (plan 01) ...`: the live pair is not deployed yet.
- `ARB_LIVE ... NOT APPROVED (run fund)`: run section 2. The arbitrage keys approve `routers.arb` (the arbitrage-only PoolSwapTest that lets the app tell arbitrage from retail swaps), the retail keys the shared PoolSwapTest.
- `PROBLEM: hook quoteFee ... != shared mirror ...`: `shared/params.json` differs from the parameters the hook was deployed with. The hook is immutable: correct `params.json` to the deployed values, never the reverse.
- `PROBLEM: protocol fee is not 0`: both pools pay it, so the V/S comparison stays fair, but write it in the session log.

## 2. Fund the bots
```bash
cd bots && bun run fund
```
Expected on the first run (later runs print only the `ready` lines):
```
[fund] ARB_LIVE 0x...: sent 0.2 ETH (0x...)
[fund] ARB_LIVE: minted 1000000 tETH (0x...)
[fund] ARB_LIVE: approved 0x<routers.arb> for tETH (0x...)
[fund] ARB_LIVE: minted 10000000000 tUSD (0x...)
[fund] ARB_LIVE: approved 0x<routers.arb> for tUSD (0x...)
[fund] ARB_LIVE 0x... ready: 0.2 ETH
[fund] NOISE_LIVE: approved 0x9B6b46e2c869aa39918Db7f52f5557FE577B6eEe for tETH (0x...)
[fund] ARB_REPLAY_PRIVATE_KEY not set: skipped
[fund] deployer 0x... left with 2.1 ETH
```

## 3. Start the live stack
Four terminals (or the tmux line below), all in `bots/`:

| Terminal | Command | Expected output |
|---|---|---|
| T1 CRE desk | `bun run cre-loop --pair live` | plan 02's loop output (`=== <time>`, `[USER LOG] ...`) and after each run: `[sim-loop live] run 2026-10-07T03:00:00Z: applied tx 0x... block 11860000 seq 12 sigmaApplied 57012 forwarderResult true` |
| T2 arbitrage | `bun run arb --pair live` | per block and pool: `[arb live] block 11860001 V pool 2713.10 vs 2713.80 gap -2.6bp band 5.0bp -> none`, and outside the band `... -> buyEth tx 0x...` |
| T3 retail | `bun run noise --pair live` | `[noise live] block 11860001 buyEth $1840 on V (fee 500 pips) tx 0x...` followed by the same order on S |
| T4 monitor | `bun run status --pair live --watch` | one line per block, as in section 1 |

```bash
cd bots && tmux new-session -d -s clim 'bun run cre-loop --pair live' \; split-window 'bun run arb --pair live' \; split-window 'bun run noise --pair live' \; split-window 'bun run status --pair live --watch' \; select-layout tiled \; attach
```

Notes:
- `cre-loop` (`bots/src/sim-loop.ts`) runs plan 02's `cre/scripts/sim-loop.sh staging-settings --broadcast` (it builds the WASM once, then simulates every 30 s; full CLI logs in `cre/logs/`), writes each run's transcript to `bots/out/cre-sim/` and records each run in `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl`. Ctrl-C stops both.
- `arb` starts with `router 0x<routers.arb>`; if it warns `routers.arb is not deployed`, the arbitrage goes through the shared PoolSwapTest and the app cannot separate it from retail flow: ask plan 01 to deploy the arbitrage router.
- The first arbitrage block moves each pool to the market price (pools start a little off): expect one large `buyEth` or `sellEth` per pool, then mostly `none`.
- `-> stale: reverted: 0x7c9c6e8f` (PriceLimitAlreadyExceeded) means another swap moved the pool after the block was read; nothing was sent and the bot retries on the next block. Occasional is normal.
- Retail routing: `mirror` (default, the same order on V and S), `split` (one pool at random) or `cheapest` (volume-leak variant): `bun run noise --pair live --routing cheapest`. Run one retail process per pair.
- Logs (all under `bots/out/`): `cre-runs.jsonl` and `security-demos.jsonl` are tracked by git (submission evidence, commit them at the end); `cre-sim/*.log`, `arb-live.jsonl` and `noise-live.jsonl` stay local.

## 4. Replay of 2026-02-04 12:00-16:00 UTC
Prerequisites: `lab/out/replay-window.json` (plan 03), the replay pools, REPLAY-flagged desk and replay hook in `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` (plan 01), the `replay-settings` target of `cre/risk-desk` with `replayUrl` = this server's base URL (plan 02 Task 12), replay keys funded (`bun run fund`).

1. Start the replay server (T5):
   ```bash
   cd bots && bun run replay-server
   ```
   Expected:
   ```
   [replay] Binance spot ETHUSDT 1s klines (close), 2026-02-04 11:30-16:00 UTC, forward-filled: 16200 s from 2026-02-04T11:30:00.000Z, main start 2026-02-04T12:00:00.000Z
   [replay] anchor 2026-10-07T03:00:00.000Z (REPLAY_ANCHOR_SEC=1791342000), offset 21135600 s
   [replay] listening on http://127.0.0.1:8787 (GET /venue/<name>/api/v3/klines, /api/v3/ticker/price, /api/v3/klines, /snapshot, /status)
   ```
   Check what plan 02's replay mode reads (one call per venue, wall-clock times):
   ```bash
   curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8787/venue/kraken/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1m&limit=20" | python3 -c "import json,sys,time; k=json.load(sys.stdin); print(len(k), int(time.time()) - k[-1][0] // 1000)"
   ```
   Expected: `20` and a number between 0 and 59 (the last kline is the wall-clock minute in progress). Restarting the server restarts the replay at 12:00 UTC; to resume instead, restart it with the anchor it printed: `REPLAY_ANCHOR_SEC=1791342000 bun run replay-server`.
2. Start the replay desk loop and the replay bots (T6-T8). If the live `cre-loop` is starting at the same moment, wait until it has printed its first run: both loops build the WASM into the same `cre/risk-desk/.cre_build_tmp.wasm`, and two builds at once make one fail (`failed to compile workflow: open .../.cre_build_tmp.wasm: no such file or directory`, seen on 2026-10-06; friction log).
   ```bash
   cd bots && ENV_FILE=.env.replay bun run cre-loop --pair replay
   cd bots && bun run arb --pair replay
   cd bots && bun run noise --pair replay
   ```
   Expected in T6: `applied` runs; `bun run status --pair replay` then shows the replay desk with `flags 2` (REPLAY). Start the replay loop as `cd bots && ENV_FILE=.env.replay bun run cre-loop --pair replay` (the line above without `ENV_FILE` sends from the live operator, and the replay desk rejects every report as `not-applied`): the replay desk's operator key is `cre/.env.replay` (plan 01 Task 18), so the live and replay loops never share a nonce.
3. If the CRE simulator cannot reach 127.0.0.1 (plan 02 Task 12 records the answer in the session log), expose the server and point the replay config at it:
   ```bash
   brew install cloudflared
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8787   # prints https://<random>.trycloudflare.com
   ```
   Set `"replayUrl"` in `cre/risk-desk/config.replay.json` to that base URL, with no path (the workflow appends `/venue/<venue>/api/v3/klines...`). Without Homebrew: `bunx localtunnel --port 8787`.
4. The replay lasts 4 hours. At the end `/status` shows `"done":true`, the candles stop, the workflow skips (`no-report`) and the replay desk goes blind.

## 5. Security demos (record both for the video)
### Forged report
A third-party key pushes sigma = 0 through the permissionless MockKeystoneForwarder:
```bash
cd bots && bun run forge-report --pair live
```
Expected (exit code 0):
```
forged report tx 0x... from 0x<NOISE_LIVE address>: status success, forwarder result=false, RiskReported in tx: 0
desk seq 12 -> 12, sigmaE9 57012 -> 57012
SIM guard held: forged report rejected
```
The verdict reads only the forged transaction's receipt (`ReportProcessed` result `false`, no `RiskReported`). T1 keeps running, so one of its reports can land between the two desk reads: the second line then reads `desk seq 12 -> 13, sigmaE9 57012 -> 57390 (another report landed in between, not this tx)` and the verdict does not change. The record is appended to `bots/out/security-demos.jsonl`. On `https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/<hash>` show the `ReportProcessed` event with `result = false` and the absence of `RiskReported`.

### Circuit breaker (blind mode)
1. Keep T4 (`status --pair live --watch`) visible.
2. Stop T1 (Ctrl-C on `cre-loop`).
3. More than `tauKillSec` (180 s) after the last report, the watch line switches to `V fee 3000 pips (30.00 bp, blind)` (or higher if sigma was already high).
4. Restart T1: after its first `applied` run the line returns to `normal`.

## 6. Evidence
```bash
grep -c '"status":"applied"' bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl                 # accepted on-chain CRE reports
grep '"status":"applied"' bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl | tail -3           # latest tx hashes
ls -t bots/out/cre-sim/*.log | head -3                                # latest run transcripts
```
`bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` and `bots/out/security-demos.jsonl` are tracked by git; the rest of `bots/out/` stays local. The other committed evidence for judges (the on-chain `RiskReported` list and a few curated run transcripts from `bots/out/cre-sim/`) is produced by plan 06's collector in `docs/evidence/`.

## 7. Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ARB_LIVE_PRIVATE_KEY is not set (see bots/.env.example)` | command not run from `bots/`, or key missing | `cd bots`, fill `bots/.env` |
| `[arb live] block N: skip (fewer than 3 venues)` | venue APIs down or rate-limited | wait; check `curl -s "https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Ticker?pair=ETHUSD"` |
| `reverted: ...` (not `stale`) on every arbitrage | missing approval or balance | `bun run fund`, then `bun run status --pair live` shows `approved` |
| cre-loop `error (...)` | `cre login` expired, wrong target, compile or RPC error | read `cre/logs/`; `cre whoami`; run `scripts/sim-loop.sh staging-settings` by hand from `cre/` |
| cre-loop `not-applied` or `forwarderResult false` | RiskDesk rejected the report (MIN_GAP 20 s, skew, nSources < 3, wrong operator key) | compare the operator address of `cre/.env` (live) or `cre/.env.replay` (replay, started with `ENV_FILE=.env.replay`) with the desk's `simOperator` |
| cre-loop `no-report` | the workflow skipped (`clim: no report (...)`: quorum, min gap) | the reason is in the `detail` field of the run |
| `nonce too low` / `replacement transaction underpriced` from fund or cre-loop | two processes sent from one operator key at once (fund and the live loop, or a replay loop started without `ENV_FILE=.env.replay`) | stop the live loop, rerun fund, restart it; start the replay loop with `ENV_FILE=.env.replay` |
| watch shows `blind` while cre-loop runs | reports failing | look at the last statuses in `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` |
| HTTP 429 from the RPC | public endpoint rate limit | set a keyed `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` |
````

- [x] **Step 3: Full check**

Run: `bun run test && bun run typecheck`
Expected: `@clim/shared test:  55 pass`, `@clim/shared test:  3 skip` (or ` 58 pass` and ` 0 skip` once `shared/abis/*.json` exist), `@clim/bots test:  66 pass`, both ` 0 fail`; both typechecks `Exited with code 0`.

- [x] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add bots/.env.example docs/runbook.md
git commit -m "docs(ops): run-book and bots environment template"
```

### Task 23: Live smoke test on Sepolia (after master Gate B)

**Delegable:** no (needs the keys, Sepolia ETH and `cre login`)
**Depends on:** plan 01 (live pair deployed, `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` filled, `shared/params.json` decided, ABIs exported), plan 02 Tasks 9 and 11 (`cre/scripts/sim-loop.sh`, the staging config pointing at the live desk), Task 22

**Files:**
- Modify: today's session log (the run logs stay in `bots/out/`, ignored by git; plan 06 collects the evidence)

- [x] **Step 1: Validate the deployment files**

Run: `bun run --cwd shared test`
Expected: ` 0 fail` and ` 0 skip` (ABIs exported, so the drift checks run). A failure names the wrong field of `sepolia.json` or `params.json`: fix the file (or plan 01's deploy script), not the validator.

- [x] **Step 2: Fund and check**

Run (CRE loop stopped, since the deployer is also the operator): `cd bots && bun run fund && bun run status --pair live`
Expected: the outputs of run-book sections 2 and 1; exit code 0; no `PROBLEM` line. If `arb` later warns that `routers.arb` is not deployed, ask plan 01 for it (contract 1) before relying on the app's arbitrage attribution.

- [x] **Step 3: One recorded CRE run**

Run: `cd bots && bun run cre-loop --pair live --once`
Expected: plan 02's loop output, then `[sim-loop live] run <time>: applied tx 0x... block N seq S sigmaApplied X forwarderResult true` and one file in `bots/out/cre-sim/`, where X is the `sigmaE9` of the workflow's `consensus:` line (or the enveloped value if the desk clamped it). `not-applied`, `rejected` or `forwarderResult false`: run-book section 7.

- [x] **Step 4: Ten minutes of the full stack**

Start the four terminals of run-book section 3, wait ten minutes, stop them (Ctrl-C), then run:
```bash
cd bots
grep -c '"status":"applied"' out/cre-runs.jsonl
grep -o '"status":"[a-z-]*"' out/cre-runs.jsonl | sort | uniq -c
grep -c '"action":"none"' out/arb-live.jsonl
grep -cE '"action":"(buyEth|sellEth)"' out/arb-live.jsonl
grep -c '"status":"success"' out/arb-live.jsonl
grep -c '"action":"stale"' out/arb-live.jsonl
grep -c txHash out/noise-live.jsonl
```
Expected: about 20 `applied` runs and few others; arbitrage decisions on both pools, swaps whose receipts are `success`, few `stale`; retail swaps in pairs (V then S); the status watch never showing `PROBLEM`.

- [x] **Step 5: Security demos**

Run: `cd bots && bun run forge-report --pair live`
Expected: `SIM guard held: forged report rejected` (exit 0). Then follow run-book section 5 "Circuit breaker" and note the times: loop stopped, `blind` seen, `normal` again.

- [x] **Step 6: Log the results**

Append under `## Build notes` in today's session log, with the numbers from Steps 4 and 5:

```markdown
- (ops) Live smoke test (plan 04 Task 23): <n> applied CRE reports in 10 min, first tx <0x...>; arbitrage swaps <n>, stale <n>; retail swaps <n>; forged report rejected (tx <0x...>); blind <t> s after the last report, normal again <t> s after restarting the loop.
```

- [x] **Step 7: Commit the results**

```bash
git add docs/sessions/
git commit -m "docs(ops): live Sepolia smoke test results"
```

---

### Task 24: Replay smoke test

**Delegable:** no (needs the keys and `cre login`)
**Depends on:** plan 03 (`lab/out/replay-window.json`), plan 01 Task 18 (replay desk with the REPLAY flag, replay hook and pools in `sepolia.json`), plan 02 Tasks 10 and 12 (replay config, localhost reachability answered), Task 23

**Files:**
- Modify: today's session log

- [x] **Step 1: Validate the window and start the server**

Run: `cd bots && bun run replay-server`
Expected: the three `[replay]` lines of run-book section 4 with `16200 s from 2026-02-04T11:30:00.000Z, main start 2026-02-04T12:00:00.000Z`. A validation error (`replay window: ...`) means plan 03's export does not follow contract 7: fix the export.

- [x] **Step 2: Check the klines as plan 02 reads them**

Run: `curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8787/venue/kraken/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1m&limit=20" | python3 -c "import json,sys,time; k=json.load(sys.stdin); print(len(k), int(time.time()) - k[-1][0] // 1000)"` and `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/status`
Expected: `20` and a number between 0 and 59, then a status with `"done":false` and `histNow` between 1770206400 and 1770220800.

- [x] **Step 3: One recorded replay run, then the replay stack**

Run: `cd bots && ENV_FILE=.env.replay bun run cre-loop --pair replay --once`
Expected: `[sim-loop replay] run <time>: applied tx 0x... ... forwarderResult true` (`ENV_FILE=.env.replay` makes plan 02's loop sign with the replay desk's own operator key, plan 01 Task 18; without it every replay run is `not-applied`). If the run's log shows `source dropped: replay <venue>: ...` for all four venues, the simulator cannot reach 127.0.0.1: apply the tunnel fallback of run-book section 4 (plan 02 Task 12 records which case holds).

Then start `ENV_FILE=.env.replay bun run cre-loop --pair replay` (its own key: it can run at any moment next to the live loop), `bun run arb --pair replay` and `bun run noise --pair replay`. After five minutes: `curl -s localhost:8787/status` shows `progress` growing, and `bun run status --pair replay` shows the replay desk reporting with `flags 2` and the V fee following the replay volatility.

- [x] **Step 4: Log and commit**

Append under `## Build notes` in today's session log:

```markdown
- (ops) Replay smoke test (plan 04 Task 24): replay desk fed through `/venue/<venue>/api/v3/klines`, first tx <0x...>; V fee <a> -> <b> pips over the first <m> minutes while S stays at <s> pips.
```

```bash
git add docs/sessions/
git commit -m "docs(ops): replay smoke test results"

## Self-review

Performed after writing the plan, and again after aligning it with plan 02 and the spec.

**1. Spec coverage**

| Requirement | Task |
|---|---|
| `shared/` package (package.json, tsconfig) | 1, 2 |
| `units.ts`: annual sigma <-> sigmaE9, pips <-> bp, fee formula mirror with the shared vectors, hook mode mirror (spec 3.6) | 2 (vectors listed in contract 3 for plan 01) |
| `index.ts` loaders for deployments, params and ABIs, typed with viem types | 5, 6 |
| Exact ABI fragments for `PoolSwapTest.swap` and `StateView.getSlot0`, checked against the deployed selectors; drift check against compiled ABIs | 5 |
| `arb.ts`: per block slot0 of V and S through StateView, market price (same venues as CRE, or the replay server), `quoteFee` for V and the static fee for S, trade only outside the band, exact-input swap through PoolSwapTest with the band-edge limit, token order and decimals | 3, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 |
| `noise.ts`: Poisson flow, random side, log-normal size, mirrored to both pools (spec 3.8), 50/50 and cheaper-pool variants, seeded | 8, 12, 15 |
| `sim-loop.ts` (`bun run cre-loop`): `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` every 30 s, non-interactive (through plan 02's loop), receipts, `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl`, per-run transcripts | 16, 17, 23 |
| `replay-server.ts`: plan 02's wall-clock `GET /venue/<venue>/api/v3/klines`, historical klines, ticker, diagnostic `/snapshot`, 1x real time; localhost reachability and tunnel fallback | 18, 19, 24, run-book section 4 |
| Funding and approvals script | 20 |
| Run-book with exact commands and expected logs | 22 |
| TDD of the pure logic: price math with decimals and token order, arbitrage decision, price limit, Poisson generator with a seed, loop output parsing, replay endpoints | 3, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18 |
| Security demos (forged report, circuit breaker) | 21, run-book section 5, 23 |
| Decisions, answers and measurements logged with exact lines | 1, 6, 17, 23, 24 |

**2. Placeholder scan:** every code step contains the complete file; there is no "TBD", "TODO" or "similar to". Angle-bracket fields appear only where a value is measured at run time (session-log lines of Tasks 23 and 24, run-book prose such as `<hash>`).

**3. Type and name consistency:** `PairName`, `PoolEntry`, `ResolvedPair` (`V`, `S`, `hook`, `desk`, `tETH`, `tUSD`), `TokenEntry`, `PairOrientation`, `DeskState`, `HookParams`, `ClimParams`, `Balances` (`native`, `ethToken`, `usdToken`, `ethAllowance`, `usdAllowance`), `RunResult` and `Snapshot` are defined once and used with the same names everywhere. Deployment keys (`tokens.tETH/tUSD`, `riskDesks.live/replay/don`, `hooks.live/replay`, `pools.*`, `routers.arb`) match plan 01's writer and plan 05's parser; plan 02's `sync-config.ts` adapts its `KEYS` (contract 1). Script names (`cre-loop`, `arb`, `noise`, `forge-report`, `fund`, `status`, `replay-server`) are canonical; plans 02 and 06 use them (plan 00 integration pass). ABI names match between `abis.ts`, `chain.ts`, the bots and the scripts. Environment names are identical in `env.ts`, the scripts, `bots/.env.example` and the run-book (`<ROLE>_<PAIR>_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`, `NOISE_*`, `REPLAY_*`, `FUND_*`, `MINT_TETH`, `MINT_TUSD`, `CRE_PROJECT_DIR`). The report field order is identical in `report.ts`, `riskDeskAbi.RiskReported`, plan 02 and the spec. Test counts in the steps are the counts measured on the validated code.
