# clim 01 · Contracts Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build, test and deploy to Ethereum Sepolia the on-chain half of clim: `RiskDesk` (receives the CRE report), `ClimHook` (Uniswap v4 dynamic-fee hook), the test tokens and the twin pools V/S, then publish addresses and ABIs to `shared/`.

**Architecture:** A Foundry project in `contracts/` inside the clim monorepo. `RiskDesk` extends Chainlink's `ReceiverTemplate` (copied from `smartcontractkit/cre-templates`) and keeps one packed slot `(tObs, sigmaE9, kE4, flags, seq)` behind freshness, quorum, envelope and `tx.origin` checks. `ClimHook` extends OpenZeppelin `BaseOverrideFee` and returns `ClimFeeMath.feePips(...) | OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG` on every swap, raised to `feeSafePips` when the desk is blind or degraded. Deploy scripts write one JSON fragment per step to `contracts/deployments/<chainId>/`; `05_WriteDeployments` checks everything on-chain and merges the fragments into `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, in the schema plan 04 validates.

**Tech Stack:** Foundry 1.4.2 (forge, cast, anvil), Solidity 0.8.26 with `evm_version = cancun`, OpenZeppelin uniswap-hooks v1.2.1 (which pins Uniswap v4-core `d153b04`, v4-periphery `7ebd04b`, OpenZeppelin Contracts 5.5.0), forge-std v1.17.0, Chainlink cre-templates `ReceiverTemplate` at commit `d0223f3`, jq, python3.

## Read this first

Every code block below was compiled and run before this plan was written (scratch project, same pins, same files). Results: 69 unit and integration tests pass, plus 2 fork tests against the real Sepolia `MockKeystoneForwarder`. The deploy scripts 00 to 05 ran end to end on an anvil fork of Sepolia for the live, replay and DON suites (re-run in the fixer pass with the `TestToken` faucet, the `SIM_OPERATOR` option, 100,000 tETH per pool and the `ok` error guard below). A report delivered through the real mock forwarder moved `quoteFee()` from `(3000, 2)` to `(526, 0)`, and the swaps then paid 526 pips on V and the static fee on S. If reality differs, change this plan and log the difference in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` (repo rule: living docs).

### Units and the fee (canonical, do not change)
- `sigmaE9` = volatility per square-root second × 1e9 = annual σ / √31,536,000 × 1e9, rounded to the nearest integer. Examples: 10 %/yr = 17,807; 48 % = 85,475; 100 % = 178,072; 225 % = 400,663; 300 % = 534,217.
- Pips: 1 pip = 1e-6, 1 bp = 100 pips, `MAX_LP_FEE` = 1,000,000.
- `fee_pips = clamp(ceil(sigmaE9 · etaE4 · sqrtHalfDtE6 · kE4 / 1e17), feeMinPips, feeMaxPips)`. The product is at most 2^112, so it cannot overflow.
- `etaE4 = round((1/P* − 0.824) × 1e4)` (spec §2.3: the constant |ζ(1/2)|/√π = 0.8239168 rounded to 0.824). This gives **41,760 at 20 % and 25,093 at 30 %**, the values the lab writes to `shared/params.json` and the values every test of this plan uses. The old P\* = 10 % vector keeps 91,761 (exact constant), as in spec §2.4. The hook takes whatever the lab writes to `shared/params.json`; plan 04's `parseParams` accepts ±1.
- `sqrtHalfDtE6` = √(12 s / 2) × 1e6 = 2,449,490 on Sepolia.
- **Rounding fix:** the design note's "48 %/yr → 1,921 pips" used floor. The canonical formula uses ceil, which gives **1,922**. The 25 %/yr check (1,001) is consistent with ceil.
- Modes returned by `quoteFee()`:
  - 0 normal;
  - 1 degraded: `flags & 1`, venue dispersion above 25 bp, fee = `max(fee, feeSafePips)`;
  - 2 blind: `tObs == 0`, or `block.timestamp > tObs + tauKillSec`, fee = `max(fee, feeSafePips)`.
  - Blind takes precedence over degraded. The comparison is written so that a `tObs` up to 30 s in the future cannot underflow.

### How a fee changes on a live pool (the mentor's question, answered by this code)
- A v4 pool's fee mode and hook are part of its `PoolKey`, hashed into the `PoolId` at `initialize`. A static-fee pool can never become dynamic.
- On a dynamic-fee pool (`fee = 0x800000`), only `key.hooks` can act on the fee: `PoolManager.updateDynamicLPFee` reverts with `UnauthorizedDynamicLPFeeUpdate` for anyone else, and `beforeSwap` can return a per-swap override flagged with `0x400000`.
- `ClimHook` uses the override. No transaction ever "sets" the fee: each swap recomputes it from `RiskDesk.state()`. The `fee` field of PoolManager's `Swap` event shows the fee charged; the Sepolia `protocolFeeController` is `0x0`, so this field is the LP fee.

### What the Sepolia mock forwarder really does (verified on a fork in Task 6)
- `MockKeystoneForwarder.report()` is permissionless and skips signature checks.
- It calls `onReport` through `this.route(...)`, so the receiver sees `msg.sender` = the mock and `tx.origin` = the EOA that sent the transaction. The `simOperator` guard therefore works.
- When `onReport` reverts, `report()` does **not** revert. It emits `ReportProcessed(receiver, executionId, reportId, false)`.
  - A successful broadcast tx does not mean the desk accepted the report.
  - The evidence of acceptance is a `RiskReported` event, or `state().seq` increasing.
- The metadata passed to `onReport` is `rawReport[45:109]` = 64 bytes. The `ReceiverTemplate` variant in `starter-templates/sports-resolution` checks for 62 bytes, so it rejects every report as soon as an identity check is set. clim copies the `circuit-breaker` variant, which has no length check (friction log row added in Task 6).

### Pinned dependencies

| What | Pin | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `OpenZeppelin/uniswap-hooks` | tag `v1.2.1` = `acbd604c409a827f7f98c9517236da860c4fca1a` | Latest release. Import `@openzeppelin/uniswap-hooks/fee/BaseOverrideFee.sol`. Override `function _getFee(address sender, PoolKey calldata key, SwapParams calldata params, bytes calldata hookData) internal virtual returns (uint24)`. It sets permissions `afterInitialize` (which reverts `NotDynamicFee()` on a static-fee key) and `beforeSwap`. |
| Uniswap v4-core (nested in uniswap-hooks) | `d153b048868a60c2403a3ef5b2301bb247884d46` | The only source difference from v4.0.0, the version deployed on Sepolia, is that `SwapParams` and `ModifyLiquidityParams` moved into `types/PoolOperation.sol`. The ABI is identical. |
| Uniswap v4-periphery (nested) | `7ebd04b161745b75ed0c24ba2df3bc7c25f65606` | Provides `HookMiner` at `src/utils/HookMiner.sol`, plus `LiquidityAmounts` and `IStateView`. |
| OpenZeppelin Contracts (nested) | `fcbae5394ae8ad52d8e580a3477db99814b9d565` (5.5.0) | `Ownable(initialOwner)`, `ERC20` and `Math`. |
| `foundry-rs/forge-std` | tag `v1.17.0` = `f3dae6e6ee381f25eb6a246f7da9b85c91a68219` | Latest tag. |
| `smartcontractkit/cre-templates` | commit `d0223f31182c76bc36b1cc9d47b13b18efcf2bf6`, path `starter-templates/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker-ts/contracts/evm/src/{ReceiverTemplate,IReceiver,IERC165}.sol` (MIT) | This variant is used by five templates. Its `setForwarderAddress(0)` is allowed and emits `SecurityWarning`; the spec's trust section relies on this. |
| solc | 0.8.26, optimizer 200 runs, `evm_version = cancun`, `bytecode_hash = none` | Matches v4-core, and gives transient storage. No `via_ir`: the two places that hit "stack too deep" are split into helper functions. |

### Deviations from the canonical layout (explicit)
- `contracts/deployments/<chainId>/*.json` holds the per-step script outputs. The Sepolia files (`11155111/`) are committed; the anvil ones (`31337/`) are gitignored. `05_WriteDeployments` merges them into `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`.
- The ABI exporter lives at `contracts/script/export-abis.sh`, not `scripts/export-abis.sh`, so that `contracts/` keeps a single script folder. `contracts/script/smoke.sh` is an extra on-chain smoke test, used on the fork and on Sepolia.
- Tests use the subfolders `contracts/test/utils/` (fixtures), `contracts/test/fork/` (Sepolia fork test) and `contracts/test/fixtures/` (a params file for dry runs).
- `shared/params.json` gets two extra fields, written by the lab (plan 03): `staticFeePips` and `replayStaticFeePips`, the fees of the static pools S. Plan 04's `parseParams` ignores extra fields.
- The `SUITE` variable also accepts `don`: a desk alone, with the production KeystoneForwarder and simulation mode off, which plan 02 Task 13 asks for. It is recorded as `riskDesks.don`.
- The live and replay suites share **one** token pair (tETH/tUSD), as plan 04's deployments schema assumes. Spec §3.7 said rETH/rUSD; the integration pass of plan 00 already updated the spec, and Task 12 checks it. The PoolKeys stay distinct because `03_CreatePools` refuses `replayStaticFeePips == staticFeePips`.
- `00_Tokens` also deploys a second `PoolSwapTest`, used only by the arbitrage bot and recorded as `routers.arb` (plan 05 identifies arbitrage swaps by `Swap.sender == routers.arb`; plan 04's `fund` and `arb` approve and swap through it).
- `TestToken` has a public `faucet()` (10 tETH or 25,000 tUSD per address per hour) next to the owner-only `mint`, so judges can try the dashboard's `/swap` and `/lp` pages with their own wallet (Frontend scope upgrade, session log 2026-10-06). It is a testnet convenience: the bots and the pools are funded by the owner's `mint`.
- The replay desk has its own operator key (`cre/.env.replay`, Task 18), passed to `01_DeployDesk` as `SIM_OPERATOR`, so the live and replay CRE loops never send from the same key (nonces). The live and DON desks keep the deployer as `simOperator`.

### Environment
- `contracts/.env` (gitignored; forge loads it automatically) holds:
  - `PRIVATE_KEY`, the deployer and `simOperator` of every desk; plan 02 uses the same key as `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`;
  - `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`;
  - optionally `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`.
- A variable set on the command line overrides `.env`. Dry runs use this to switch to the anvil key.
- Script variables:
  - `SUITE` = `live` | `replay` | `don` (default `live`);
  - `PARAMS_PATH` (default `../shared/params.json`); it must lie under `../shared/` or `./test/fixtures/`, the only read paths `foundry.toml`'s `fs_permissions` allow (any other path fails with `vm.readFile: the path ... is not allowed to be accessed for read operations`);
  - `INIT_ETH_USD` (whole dollars);
  - `LIQ_TETH` (whole tETH per pool, default 100,000: L ≈ 5.2e24 at $2,713, so a $2,000 order moves the price about 0.15 bp, measured 0.147 bp on a fork);
  - `MINT_TETH` (default 1,000,000) and `MINT_TUSD` (default 10,000,000,000);
  - `FORWARDER` (defaults: the mock forwarder, or KeystoneForwarder for `don`);
  - `SIM_OPERATOR` (`01_DeployDesk` only, default the deployer): the address allowed to send simulated reports to the new desk; Task 18 sets it to the replay operator.
- **Error guard for chained deploy scripts.** `forge script ... | grep ...` exits 0 even when the script fails (grep matches the `Error` line), so a plain `&&` chain would go on to the next script. Every chained deploy command below defines and uses:
  ```bash
  ok(){ out=$("$@" 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -E "ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE|Error" || echo "$out" | grep -E "Script ran successfully"; ! echo "$out" | grep -q "Error"; }
  ```
  `ok forge script ...` prints the same lines as before (`ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE & SUCCESSFUL.` for a broadcast, `Script ran successfully.` otherwise, or the `Error` lines) and fails as soon as the output contains `Error`, which stops the chain.
- Commands in this plan start with `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/...` because the shell's working directory resets between calls. Where a command uses `$PRIVATE_KEY` or `$SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` in the shell (cast, curl), it first runs `set -a && source .env && set +a`.

## Interfaces for other plans (produced here)

`shared/deployments/sepolia.json`. This is plan 04's schema; `parseDeployments` ignores the extra keys, which are `deployer`, `riskDesks.don` and `liquidity`:
```json
{
  "chainId": 11155111,
  "deployBlock": 11855528,
  "deployer": "0x… (= simOperator of the live and DON desks = address of CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY in cre/.env)",
  "uniswap": { "poolManager": "0x…", "stateView": "0x…", "poolSwapTest": "0x…", "poolModifyLiquidityTest": "0x…" },
  "cre": { "mockForwarder": "0x…", "keystoneForwarder": "0x…" },
  "tokens": { "tETH": { "address": "0x…", "symbol": "tETH", "decimals": 18 }, "tUSD": { "address": "0x…", "symbol": "tUSD", "decimals": 18 } },
  "routers": { "arb": "0x… (second PoolSwapTest, arbitrage bot only)" },
  "riskDesks": { "live": "0x…", "replay": "0x… or null", "don": "0x… or null" },
  "hooks": { "live": "0x…", "replay": "0x… or null" },
  "pools": {
    "liveV": { "key": { "currency0": "0x…", "currency1": "0x…", "hooks": "0x…", "fee": 8388608, "tickSpacing": 60 }, "poolId": "0x…", "token0IsEth": false },
    "liveS": { "key": { "…": "…", "hooks": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "fee": 600 }, "poolId": "0x…", "token0IsEth": false },
    "replayV": null,
    "replayS": null
  },
  "liquidity": { "live": "5208646657242166984120997", "replay": null }
}
```
`deployBlock` is the block number read when `00_Tokens` ran, just before the token deployment; use it as the `fromBlock` of log queries. `routers.arb` is `null` only if `tokens.json` was written by an older `00_Tokens` without the router. `liquidity` values are decimal strings, because L exceeds 2^53. The values shown are examples from the fork dry run.

---

### Task 1: Verify the Sepolia infrastructure and prepare the deployer key

**Delegable:** no (it creates the operator key, which is also the TestToken owner and the live desk's `simOperator`; a helper can run Step 3, the read-only `cast` checks)
**Depends on:** nothing

**Files:**
- Create: `contracts/.env.example`, `contracts/.env` (never committed)
- Modify: `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Create the env template**

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts
```

Then write `contracts/.env.example`:
```bash
# Copy to contracts/.env (gitignored). Testnet keys only. Forge loads this file automatically.
# PRIVATE_KEY deploys everything and is the RiskDesk simOperator: plan 02 must put the same key in cre/.env
# as CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY, otherwise every simulated report is rejected.
PRIVATE_KEY=
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com
# Optional, only for Task 17 (contract verification on Etherscan).
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Create `contracts/.env` with a fresh testnet key (pending: operator key, done later in the main tree)**

```bash
cast wallet new
```
Expected: `Successfully created new keypair.`, then an `Address:` line and a `Private key:` line. Copy `contracts/.env.example` to `contracts/.env`, then paste the private key after `PRIVATE_KEY=`. Use this key only on testnets. Plan 02 puts the same key in `cre/.env` as `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`.

- [x] **Step 3: Verify every Sepolia address on-chain**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && set -a && source .env && set +a && R=$SEPOLIA_RPC_URL && \
cast chain-id --rpc-url $R && \
for a in 0xE03A1074c86CFeDd5C142C4F04F1a1536e203543 0xE1Dd9c3fA50EDB962E442f60DfBc432e24537E4C 0x9B6b46e2c869aa39918Db7f52f5557FE577B6eEe 0x0C478023803a644c94c4CE1C1e7b9A087e411B0A 0x15fC6ae953E024d975e77382eEeC56A9101f9F88 0xF8344CFd5c43616a4366C34E3EEE75af79a74482 0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C; do echo "$a $(cast codesize $a --rpc-url $R)"; done && \
cast call 0x15fC6ae953E024d975e77382eEeC56A9101f9F88 "typeAndVersion()(string)" --rpc-url $R && \
cast call 0xF8344CFd5c43616a4366C34E3EEE75af79a74482 "typeAndVersion()(string)" --rpc-url $R && \

cast call 0xE03A1074c86CFeDd5C142C4F04F1a1536e203543 "protocolFeeController()(address)" --rpc-url $R
```
Expected (verified on 2026-10-06):

```
If any code size is 0, or any view call returns something else, stop. Update the address in `contracts/script/base/ClimScript.sol` (Task 10) and in the spec, and log the change.

- [ ] **Step 4: Check the deployer's balance (pending: operator key, done later in the main tree)**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && set -a && source .env && set +a && cast balance $(cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY) --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --ether
```
Expected: at least `0.05`. The whole live suite uses under 7M gas: about 0.007 ETH at Sepolia's 1 gwei on 2026-10-06. If the balance is lower, fund the address from a Sepolia faucet and run the command again.

- [x] **Step 5: Log the verification**

Append to `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`. If the section `## Contracts (plan 01)` does not exist, create it at the end of the file first.
```markdown
## Contracts (plan 01)
- **Sepolia infra verified on-chain** (code size and view calls):
  - PoolManager `0xE03A…3543` (24,009 B, `protocolFeeController` = 0x0, so the `Swap` event's `fee` is the LP fee).
  - StateView `0xE1Dd…7E4C`, PoolSwapTest `0x9B6b…6eEe` and PoolModifyLiquidityTest `0x0C47…1B0A`: each points at that PoolManager.
  - MockKeystoneForwarder `0x15fC…9F88` ("MockKeystoneForwarder 1.0.0") and KeystoneForwarder `0xF834…4482` ("KeystoneForwarder 1.0.0").
  - CREATE2 deployer `0x4e59…956C` (69 B).
```

- [x] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add contracts/.env.example docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md && git status --short && git commit -m "chore(contracts): env template and verified Sepolia infrastructure"
```

### Task 2: Foundry bootstrap: dependencies, config, vendored receiver, build check

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 1. The repository must have at least one commit (plan 00's first commit, or Task 1's).

**Files:**
- Create: `contracts/foundry.toml`, `contracts/remappings.txt`, `contracts/src/receiver/ReceiverTemplate.sol`, `contracts/src/receiver/IReceiver.sol`, `contracts/src/receiver/IERC165.sol`
- Generated: `.gitmodules`, `contracts/foundry.lock`, `contracts/lib/forge-std`, `contracts/lib/uniswap-hooks`
- Modify: `.gitignore`, `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Write the Foundry config**

Do **not** run `forge init`: inside a monorepo it creates a nested `.git` in `contracts/`.

`contracts/foundry.toml`:
```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
test = "test"
script = "script"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]
solc_version = "0.8.26"
evm_version = "cancun"
optimizer = true
optimizer_runs = 200
bytecode_hash = "none"
fs_permissions = [
  { access = "read", path = "../shared" },
  { access = "write", path = "../shared/deployments" },
  { access = "read-write", path = "./deployments" },
  { access = "read", path = "./test/fixtures" },
]

[fuzz]
runs = 1000

[rpc_endpoints]
sepolia = "${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL}"
anvil = "http://127.0.0.1:8545"

[lint]
lint_on_build = false
```

`contracts/remappings.txt`:
```text

```

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts/{src/receiver,src/interfaces,src/libraries,src/test-tokens,test/utils,test/fork,test/fixtures,script/base} /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/shared/{deployments,abis}
```

- [x] **Step 2: Install the dependencies**

The install is slow: it clones about 25 nested submodules and took 12 to 15 minutes on 2026-10-06. Run it with `run_in_background: true` and wait for it to finish. Do not add `--shallow`: in forge 1.4.2, `--shallow` cannot check out a tag (`Error: Tag: "v1.17.0" not found`).
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && forge install foundry-rs/forge-std@v1.17.0 OpenZeppelin/uniswap-hooks@v1.2.1
```
Expected (last lines):
```
    Installed forge-std tag=v1.17.0@f3dae6e6ee381f25eb6a246f7da9b85c91a68219
    Installed uniswap-hooks tag=v1.2.1@acbd604c409a827f7f98c9517236da860c4fca1a
```

- [x] **Step 3: Stage the submodules at the tags and verify the pins**

`forge install` stages each submodule at the default-branch HEAD and checks the tag out only in the working tree. `git add` records the tag commits.
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add .gitmodules contracts/lib/forge-std contracts/lib/uniswap-hooks contracts/foundry.lock && git submodule status contracts/lib/forge-std contracts/lib/uniswap-hooks && git -C contracts/lib/uniswap-hooks submodule status lib/v4-core lib/v4-periphery lib/openzeppelin-contracts
```
Expected: no line starts with `+` or `-`, and the commits are exactly:
```
 f3dae6e6ee381f25eb6a246f7da9b85c91a68219 contracts/lib/forge-std (v1.17.0)

 fcbae5394ae8ad52d8e580a3477db99814b9d565 lib/openzeppelin-contracts (…)
```

- [x] **Step 4: Vendor the Chainlink receiver at the pinned commit and check the hashes**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts/src/receiver && C=d0223f31182c76bc36b1cc9d47b13b18efcf2bf6 && for f in ReceiverTemplate.sol IReceiver.sol IERC165.sol; do curl -fsSL -o $f "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartcontractkit/cre-templates/$C/starter-templates/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker-ts/contracts/evm/src/$f"; done && shasum -a 256 ReceiverTemplate.sol IReceiver.sol IERC165.sol
```
Expected:
```
cebb2e698a20ca6ba41e8bff1777a537df0715c923d9e263f2b5b3f8fe06677d  ReceiverTemplate.sol

c6a3b82a876e50eba9cd4673a712f861eca2a476cd2ad28fc0f26e66ae5f2dda  IERC165.sol
```
Do not edit these files. Their MIT headers stay as they are.

- [x] **Step 5: Ignore the local dry-run outputs**

Append to `/Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/.gitignore`:
```gitignore

# Foundry dry runs on a local anvil fork
contracts/deployments/31337/
shared/deployments/anvil.json
```

- [x] **Step 6: Build check**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && forge build
```
Expected: `Compiler run successful!`. The first run downloads solc 0.8.26. This compiles the vendored receiver against OpenZeppelin 5.5.0's `Ownable`, which validates the remappings.

- [x] **Step 7: Log the pins**

Append under `## Contracts (plan 01)` in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`:
```markdown
- **Contract dependencies pinned:**
  - OpenZeppelin uniswap-hooks v1.2.1 (`acbd604`), which brings v4-core `d153b04`, v4-periphery `7ebd04b` and OZ Contracts 5.5.0; forge-std v1.17.0; solc 0.8.26, evm cancun.
  - v4-core `d153b04` differs from the v4.0.0 PoolManager on Sepolia only by moving `SwapParams`/`ModifyLiquidityParams` into `types/PoolOperation.sol`. The ABI is unchanged.
  - Foundry: `forge install --shallow` cannot check out tags (forge 1.4.2), and the full recursive install takes 12 to 15 min. Never `forge init` inside the monorepo: it creates a nested `.git`.
- **ReceiverTemplate source:** cre-templates `d0223f3`, `starter-templates/circuit-breaker/circuit-breaker-ts/contracts/evm/src/` (MIT).
  - Not the `sports-resolution` variant: its 62-byte metadata check rejects the forwarder's 64-byte metadata (friction log).
```

- [x] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add .gitignore .gitmodules contracts/foundry.toml contracts/remappings.txt contracts/foundry.lock contracts/lib/forge-std contracts/lib/uniswap-hooks contracts/src/receiver docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md && git commit -m "build(contracts): Foundry project, pinned v4 and OZ hooks deps, vendored CRE receiver"
```

  - etaE4 uses the rounded constant 0.824 everywhere (spec §2.3): 41,760 at P* = 20 % and 25,093 at 30 % (the exact 0.8239168 would give 41,761 and 25,094; immaterial, and plan 04 accepts ±1).

- [ ] **Step 5: Log the desk constants**

Append under `## Contracts (plan 01)` in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`:
```markdown
- **RiskDesk:**
  - `SIGMA_MAX_E9` = 1,780,730 is 1000.003 %/yr (exact 1000 % = 1,780,724). Kept as specified, harmless.
  - `RiskReported.kE4` logs the applied (clamped) k, and sigma is logged both applied and reported.
  - The first report gets only the absolute bounds [17,807, 1,780,730], with no gap check.
  - `zone` is logged only (0 not validated, 1 green, 2 yellow, 3 red, as in spec §3.4 and plan 02).
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run, expected PASS**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && forge test --match-path 'test/fork/*' -vv
```
Expected (`.env` holds `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`): `[PASS] test_OperatorReportIsDelivered()`, `[PASS] test_ThirdPartyReportIsSwallowedNotReverted()`, `Suite result: ok. 2 passed`. Without the variable: `[SKIP: skipped] setUp()`. From now on, `forge test` includes these two fork tests whenever `.env` sets `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`; add `--no-match-path 'test/fork/*'` to stay offline.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update the CRE friction log**

In `docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md`:
- Row 1 (Simulation trust model): set its Status cell to `confirmed on a Sepolia fork (contracts/test/fork/MockForwarder.fork.t.sol): report() is permissionless; clim's tx.origin guard rejects third parties`.
- Row 2 (Docs): set its Status cell to `code side confirmed on a Sepolia fork: the deployed mock ("MockKeystoneForwarder 1.0.0") calls onReport with msg.sender = mock and tx.origin = sender; docs page still to re-find`.
- The row about a rejected report that still looks successful (`ReportProcessed(..., false)`; plan 02 adds it as "Simulation write status"): if it exists, set its Status to `confirmed with clim's RiskDesk on a Sepolia fork (test_ThirdPartyReportIsSwallowedNotReverted): tx succeeds, ReportProcessed result = false, desk unchanged`. If it does not exist, append it with the next free number:
```markdown
| <next> | Simulation write status | `MockKeystoneForwarder.report` never reverts when the consumer's `onReport` reverts: it emits `ReportProcessed(receiver, executionId, reportId, false)` and the transaction succeeds. A rejected report looks like a success. | Decode `ReportProcessed` in `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` and report the consumer's revert. | confirmed with clim's RiskDesk on a Sepolia fork (contracts/test/fork/MockForwarder.fork.t.sol) |
```
- Append the next row (replace `<next>` with the next free number):
```markdown
| <next> | Receiver template | `starter-templates/sports-resolution/.../ReceiverTemplate.sol` (cre-templates `d0223f3`) requires `metadata.length == 62`, but KeystoneForwarder and MockKeystoneForwarder pass `rawReport[45:109]` = 64 bytes (workflow id 32, name 10, owner 20, report id 2). As soon as `setExpectedWorkflowId` / `Author` / `Name` is set, every report reverts `InvalidMetadataLength(64, 62)`. Reproduced with a forge test feeding real forwarder metadata. The other templates (circuit-breaker, event-reactor, …) have no length check. | Set `METADATA_LENGTH` to 64 and add a test with real forwarder metadata. Candidate upstream PR. | verified (forge test) |
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Log it**

Append under `## Contracts (plan 01)` in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`:
```markdown
- **Mock forwarder behaviour verified on a Sepolia fork:** `onReport` gets `msg.sender` = mock and `tx.origin` = the sending EOA, so the SIM guard works.
  - A rejected report does not revert the transaction (`ReportProcessed(result = false)`).
  - Bots and the CRE loop must check `RiskReported` or `state().seq`, not the tx status.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add contracts/test/fork/MockForwarder.fork.t.sol docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md && git commit -m "test(contracts): fork test of the Sepolia MockKeystoneForwarder against RiskDesk"
```

### Task 7: TestToken

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 2

The owner mints the pools' and the bots' tokens. `faucet()` lets any visitor of the dashboard get 10 tETH or 25,000 tUSD once per hour per address (amount fixed at construction), for the `/swap` and `/lp` pages (Frontend scope upgrade; plan 05's app calls `faucet()` with no argument). The custom error `FaucetCooldown(uint256 nextAt)` has selector `0x12272bab`.

### Task 8: ClimHook

**Delegable:** no
**Depends on:** Tasks 3, 5

**Files:**
- Create: `contracts/src/ClimHook.sol`
- Test: `contracts/test/utils/HookHelpers.sol`, `contracts/test/ClimHook.t.sol`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the v4 fixtures and the failing test**

`HookHelpers` uses v4-core's `Deployers`, which provides a real `PoolManager`, routers and sorted, minted, approved currencies. It deploys the hook with `deployCodeTo` at an address whose low bits are `AFTER_INITIALIZE_FLAG | BEFORE_SWAP_FLAG`, and reads the fee actually charged from the `Swap` event.

### Task 9: Integration test (twin pools, one storm)

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 8

**Files:**
- Test: `contracts/test/Integration.t.sol`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test**

The story it tells:
- blind before the first report;
- calm at 48 %/yr, 526 pips;
- a storm capped by the envelope: 1,051, then 2,102, then 4,203;
- a spoofed report rejected;
- blind with the storm fee kept;
- recovery, with σ decaying 20 % per report.

V and S get identical swaps; S always charges 1,000.

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && forge test --match-path test/Integration.t.sol && forge test --no-match-path 'test/fork/*'

### Task 11: 02_DeployHook

**Delegable:** no
**Depends on:** Tasks 8, 10

**Files:**

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the script**

The hook is deployed by a raw call to the CREATE2 deployer (`salt ‖ initCode`), not `new ClimHook{salt: …}(8 args)`. That expression hits "stack too deep" without `via_ir`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run, expected PASS**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && forge test --match-path test/CreatePools.t.sol
```
Expected: `Suite result: ok. 3 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Check the spec (one token pair, static fees in params.json)**

The plan 00 integration pass already wrote both changes into the spec (§3.7 "Replay pair" and the §2.6 `shared/params.json` table). Check they are there:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && grep -c "shares the tETH/tUSD pair with the live pair" docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-clim-design.md && grep -c "replayStaticFeePips" docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-clim-design.md
```
Expected: `1`, then a count of at least `1`. If either is `0`, replace the spec's §3.7 "Replay pair" paragraph with
```markdown
**Replay pair.** It shares the tETH/tUSD pair with the live pair, as in plan 04's deployments schema, but has its own `RiskDesk` (REPLAY flag set) and its own `ClimHook` bound to that desk. The PoolKeys stay distinct: replay V differs by its hook, and replay S by its fee, because `03_CreatePools` refuses a `replayStaticFeePips` equal to `staticFeePips`. The two pairs have independent prices; only token balances are shared.
```
and add to the §2.6 `shared/params.json` fields table the rows
```markdown
| `staticFeePips` | integer | Fee of the live S pool: the lab's forecast of V's time-average fee over the demo window |
| `replayStaticFeePips` | integer | Fee of the replay S pool: V's exact time-average fee over the replay window; must differ from `staticFeePips` |
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Log it**

Append under `## Contracts (plan 01)` in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`:
```markdown
- **Decision: one token pair for the live and replay suites** (matches plan 04's deployments schema). Spec §3.7 is updated.
  - `03_CreatePools` refuses `replayStaticFeePips == staticFeePips`, the only way the two S keys could collide.
  - The S fees come from `shared/params.json` (`staticFeePips`, `replayStaticFeePips`), written by the lab.
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add contracts/script/03_CreatePools.s.sol contracts/test/CreatePools.t.sol docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-06-clim-design.md docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md && git commit -m "feat(contracts): twin pool initialization script, spec update for the shared token pair"

### Task 13: 04_AddLiquidity and 05_WriteDeployments

**Delegable:** no
**Depends on:** Task 12

**Files:**
- Create: `contracts/script/04_AddLiquidity.s.sol`, `contracts/script/05_WriteDeployments.s.sol`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write 04_AddLiquidity**

L is sized so that each pool holds `LIQ_TETH` tETH at the initial price. The default of 100,000 tETH gives L ≈ 5.2e24 at $2,713, the depth plan 04 asks for: a $2,000 retail order then moves the price about 0.15 bp (measured 0.147 bp on a Sepolia fork), far below the per-block volatility (about 3 bp at 50 %/yr), so retail flow does not distort the arbitrage-frequency check. With 10,000 tETH a $2,000 order moved it about 1.5 bp (measured 1.25 bp for $1,696). Both suites use 400,000 of the 1,000,000 minted tETH and about 1 billion of the 10 billion tUSD. V and S get the same L, and the script asserts it.

Expected: `Compiler run successful!`, then `69 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (69 total tests)`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash

### Task 14: ABI export and on-chain smoke script

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 13

**Files:**
- Create: `contracts/script/export-abis.sh`, `contracts/script/smoke.sh`, `shared/abis/*.json` (generated)

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the exporter**

`contracts/script/export-abis.sh`. It writes the same `shared/abis/<Name>.json` files as plan 04's `bun run --cwd shared export-abis`, plus five more. Either exporter can run; the outputs are identical.
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Copies the ABIs that cre/, bots/ and app/ consume from Foundry artifacts to shared/abis/.
# Run from anywhere: contracts/script/export-abis.sh
set -euo pipefail
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."

  name="${artifact##*/}"
  jq '.abi' "out/${artifact}.json" > "${OUT}/${name}.json"
  echo "${OUT}/${name}.json"
done
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the smoke script**

`contracts/script/smoke.sh`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# On-chain smoke test of a deployed clim suite: quoteFee, optional report through the MockKeystoneForwarder,
# then one tiny swap on V and on S, printing the fee each swap paid (PoolManager Swap event, last field).
# Usage: script/smoke.sh <rpc-url> <deployments.json> [live|replay]
# Env: PRIVATE_KEY (deployer = simOperator). PUSH_REPORT=1 also delivers one 48 %/yr report (use on forks only).
set -euo pipefail

```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the exporter**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && chmod +x script/export-abis.sh script/smoke.sh && ./script/export-abis.sh && jq -r '[.[] | select(.type=="function") | .name] | join(",")' ../shared/abis/ClimHook.json
```
Expected: eight lines `../shared/abis/RiskDesk.json`, `IRiskDesk.json`, `ClimHook.json`, `TestToken.json`, `IPoolManager.json`, `IStateView.json`, `PoolSwapTest.json`, `PoolModifyLiquidityTest.json`, then a list that contains `quoteFee`, `desk`, `etaE4`, `feeMinPips`, `feeMaxPips`, `feeSafePips`, `tauKillSec`, `MODE_BLIND`, `MODE_DEGRADED`, `MODE_NORMAL`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash

```

### Task 15: Dry run on an anvil fork of Sepolia

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 14

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` (outputs go to gitignored paths)

- [ ] **Step 1: Start a fork with chain id 31337**

With chain id 31337, outputs go to `deployments/31337/` and `shared/deployments/anvil.json`, and the params guard stays off. Start the fork with `run_in_background: true`:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && set -a && source .env && set +a && anvil --fork-url "$SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" --chain-id 31337 --port 8545 --silent
```
Then:
```bash
until cast chain-id --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 >/dev/null 2>&1; do sleep 1; done; cast chain-id --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```
Expected: `31337`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Deploy the live, replay and DON suites with anvil's first key and the fixture params**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && export PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 PARAMS_PATH=test/fixtures/params.p30.json && \
ok(){ out=$("$@" 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -E "ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE|Error" || echo "$out" | grep -E "Script ran successfully"; ! echo "$out" | grep -q "Error"; } && \
ok forge script script/00_Tokens.s.sol --rpc-url anvil --broadcast && \
F=0; for S in live replay; do P=$([ $S = live ] && echo 2713 || echo 2254); \
  SUITE=$S ok forge script script/01_DeployDesk.s.sol --rpc-url anvil --broadcast && \
  SUITE=$S ok forge script script/02_DeployHook.s.sol --rpc-url anvil --broadcast && \
  SUITE=$S INIT_ETH_USD=$P ok forge script script/03_CreatePools.s.sol --rpc-url anvil --broadcast && \
  SUITE=$S ok forge script script/04_AddLiquidity.s.sol --rpc-url anvil --broadcast || { F=1; break; }; done; [ $F = 0 ] && \
SUITE=don ok forge script script/01_DeployDesk.s.sol --rpc-url anvil --broadcast && \
{ SUITE=don forge script script/02_DeployHook.s.sol --rpc-url anvil 2>&1 | grep -E "Error"; true; } && \
ok forge script script/05_WriteDeployments.s.sol --rpc-url anvil
```
Expected: ten lines `ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE & SUCCESSFUL.`, then `Error: script failed: SUITE=don has no hook and no pools` (the guard working), then `Script ran successfully.` Any other `Error` line stops the chain at that script.

- [ ] **Step 3: Check the merged file against plan 04's rules**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && D=shared/deployments/anvil.json && for p in liveV liveS replayV replayS; do id=$(cast keccak $(cast abi-encode "f(address,address,uint24,int24,address)" $(jq -r ".pools.$p.key.currency0" $D) $(jq -r ".pools.$p.key.currency1" $D) $(jq -r ".pools.$p.key.fee" $D) $(jq -r ".pools.$p.key.tickSpacing" $D) $(jq -r ".pools.$p.key.hooks" $D))); [ "$id" = "$(jq -r .pools.$p.poolId $D)" ] && echo "$p poolId OK" || echo "$p MISMATCH"; done && jq -c '{dyn: [.pools.liveV.key.fee, .pools.replayV.key.fee], hooksMatch: (.pools.liveV.key.hooks == .hooks.live and .pools.replayV.key.hooks == .hooks.replay), sStatic: [.pools.liveS.key.fee, .pools.replayS.key.fee], sorted: (.pools.liveV.key.currency0 < .pools.liveV.key.currency1), liq: .liquidity, arb: (.routers.arb != null)}' $D && cast call $(jq -r .riskDesks.don $D) "simMode()(bool)" --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 && cast call $(jq -r .routers.arb $D) "manager()(address)" --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```
Expected: four `poolId OK` lines, then `{"dyn":[8388608,8388608],"hooksMatch":true,"sStatic":[600,2500],"sorted":true,"liq":{"live":"…","replay":"…"},"arb":true}` (live L ≈ 5.2e24: the fixer pass measured `5208646657242166984120997` at $2,713), then `false`, then `0xE03A1074c86CFeDd5C142C4F04F1a1536e203543` (the arbitrage router points at the PoolManager).

`sorted` compares checksummed hex strings. It is a quick check; plan 04's parser compares them as numbers.

- [ ] **Step 4: Smoke test: a report through the real mock forwarder, then swaps on V and S**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 PUSH_REPORT=1 ./script/smoke.sh http://127.0.0.1:8545 ../shared/deployments/anvil.json live
```
Expected:
```
quoteFee before: 3000 2
desk state: <now> [...] 85475 [8.547e4] 10000 [1e4] 0 1
quoteFee after report: 526 0
V swap fee (pips): 526
S swap fee (pips): 600
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Stop the fork and remove the dry-run outputs**

```bash
pkill -f "anvil --fork-url"; rm -rf /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts/deployments/31337 /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/shared/deployments/anvil.json; cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git status --short
```
Expected: `git status --short` shows no file under `contracts/deployments/`, `contracts/broadcast/`, or `shared/deployments/anvil.json`. Broadcasts on chain 31337 are gitignored.

- [ ] **Step 6: Log and commit**

Append under `## Contracts (plan 01)` in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`:
```markdown
- **Dry run on an anvil fork of Sepolia passed:**
  - Scripts 00 to 05 ran for the live, replay and DON suites.
  - One report went through the real MockKeystoneForwarder.
  - Swap fees: V paid `quoteFee()`, S paid its static fee.
```
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md && git commit -m "docs(sessions): contracts dry run on a Sepolia fork"
```

### Task 16: GATE, then deploy the live suite to Sepolia

**Delegable:** no (it uses the deployer key; it is the gate the rest of the demo depends on)
**Depends on:** Task 15, plus the lab decision in plan 03, which writes `shared/params.json` with the final P\*, `staticFeePips`, `replayStaticFeePips` and a `decidedBy` that does not start with `PROVISIONAL` or `FIXTURE`. **Hook parameters are immutable:** never run this task on provisional parameters.

**Files:**
- Create: `contracts/deployments/11155111/*.json`, `contracts/broadcast/*/11155111/*.json`
- Modify: `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, `shared/abis/*.json`, `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Gate checks**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && set -a && source .env && set +a && \
jq -e '(.decidedBy | (startswith("PROVISIONAL") or startswith("FIXTURE"))) | not' ../shared/params.json && \
jq -e '.staticFeePips > 0 and .replayStaticFeePips != .staticFeePips and .feeMinPips <= .feeSafePips and .feeSafePips <= .feeMaxPips' ../shared/params.json && \
cast balance $(cast wallet address --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY) --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --ether && \
forge test 2>&1 | tail -1
```
Expected: `true`, `true`, a balance of at least `0.05`, and `71 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (71 total tests)`. Stop on any other output. `02_DeployHook` also refuses non-decided params on chain 11155111: a second, independent guard.

- [ ] **Step 2: Deploy tokens, desk and hook**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && \
ok(){ out=$("$@" 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -E "ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE|Error" || echo "$out" | grep -E "Script ran successfully"; ! echo "$out" | grep -q "Error"; } && \
ok forge script script/00_Tokens.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --slow && \
SUITE=live ok forge script script/01_DeployDesk.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --slow && \
SUITE=live ok forge script script/02_DeployHook.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --slow && \
cat deployments/11155111/tokens.json deployments/11155111/desk-live.json deployments/11155111/hook-live.json
```
Expected: three `ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE & SUCCESSFUL.` lines and three JSON fragments. `hook` must end in `…1080` or another value whose last 14 bits are `0x1080` (afterInitialize 0x1000 | beforeSwap 0x80).

- [ ] **Step 3: Create the pools at the current ETH price and add liquidity**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && export INIT_ETH_USD=$(curl -s https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/ETH-USD/spot | jq -r '.data.amount | tonumber | floor') && echo "INIT_ETH_USD=$INIT_ETH_USD" && \
ok(){ out=$("$@" 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -E "ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE|Error" || echo "$out" | grep -E "Script ran successfully"; ! echo "$out" | grep -q "Error"; } && \
SUITE=live ok forge script script/03_CreatePools.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --slow && \
SUITE=live ok forge script script/04_AddLiquidity.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --slow
```
Expected: a plausible price (`INIT_ETH_USD=2713` on 2026-10-06), then two `ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE & SUCCESSFUL.` lines.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write shared/deployments/sepolia.json and the ABIs**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && ok(){ out=$("$@" 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -E "ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE|Error" || echo "$out" | grep -E "Script ran successfully"; ! echo "$out" | grep -q "Error"; } && ok forge script script/05_WriteDeployments.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia && ./script/export-abis.sh >/dev/null && jq -c '{chainId, riskDesks, hooks, routers, liveS: .pools.liveS.key.fee, liq: .liquidity.live}' ../shared/deployments/sepolia.json
```
Expected: `Script ran successfully.`, then one JSON line: `chainId` is 11155111, `riskDesks.live`, `hooks.live` and `routers.arb` are addresses, `replay` and `don` are null, and `liveS` is `staticFeePips`. If plan 04 is set up (`shared/src/config.ts`), also run `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/shared && bun test test/config.test.ts`. Expected: ` 0 fail`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Smoke on Sepolia (no report pushed: the first report must come from CRE)**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && set -a && source .env && set +a && ./script/smoke.sh "$SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" ../shared/deployments/sepolia.json live
```
Expected:
- `quoteFee before: 3000 2` (blind: the desk has never reported);
- `V swap fee (pips): 3000`;
- `S swap fee (pips):` equal to `staticFeePips`.

The two swaps also leave the PoolSwapTest approvals in place for the bots.

- [ ] **Step 6: Log, commit, hand over**

Append under `## Contracts (plan 01)` in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`:
```markdown
- **Live suite deployed on Sepolia:** addresses (including the arbitrage router `routers.arb`) in `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, transactions in `contracts/broadcast/*/11155111/run-latest.json`.
  - Smoke: V quoted the blind fee (3000 pips), and S charged its static fee.
  - Next: plan 02 points the workflow at `riskDesks.live`, with `CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY` = the deployer key.
```
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add contracts/deployments/11155111 contracts/broadcast shared/deployments/sepolia.json shared/abis docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md && git commit -m "deploy(contracts): live clim suite on Sepolia (tokens, RiskDesk, ClimHook, twin pools)" && git show --stat --oneline HEAD | cat
```
Expected: the commit lists `contracts/deployments/11155111/{tokens,desk-live,hook-live,pools-live,liquidity-live}.json`, the `contracts/broadcast/*/11155111/` run files, `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, `shared/abis/*.json` and the session log. Neither `contracts/.env` nor `contracts/cache/` appears.

### Task 17: Verify the contracts on Etherscan

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 16, and `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in `contracts/.env` (a free Etherscan account; one v2 key covers Sepolia)

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Verify the four contracts**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && set -a && source .env && set +a && D=../shared/deployments/sepolia.json && P=../shared/params.json && DEPLOYER=$(jq -r .deployer $D) && \
forge verify-contract $(jq -r .tokens.tETH.address $D) src/test-tokens/TestToken.sol:TestToken --chain sepolia --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY --watch --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(string,string,address,uint256)" "clim test ETH" "tETH" $DEPLOYER 10000000000000000000) && \
forge verify-contract $(jq -r .tokens.tUSD.address $D) src/test-tokens/TestToken.sol:TestToken --chain sepolia --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY --watch --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(string,string,address,uint256)" "clim test USD" "tUSD" $DEPLOYER 25000000000000000000000) && \
forge verify-contract $(jq -r .riskDesks.live $D) src/RiskDesk.sol:RiskDesk --chain sepolia --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY --watch --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address,address,bool)" $(jq -r .cre.mockForwarder $D) $DEPLOYER false) && \
forge verify-contract $(jq -r .hooks.live $D) src/ClimHook.sol:ClimHook --chain sepolia --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY --watch --constructor-args $(cast abi-encode "constructor(address,address,uint32,uint32,uint24,uint24,uint24,uint32)" $(jq -r .uniswap.poolManager $D) $(jq -r .riskDesks.live $D) $(jq -r .etaE4 $P) $(jq -r .sqrtHalfDtE6 $P) $(jq -r .feeMinPips $P) $(jq -r .feeMaxPips $P) $(jq -r .feeSafePips $P) $(jq -r .tauKillSec $P))
```
Expected: each command ends with `Pass - Verified` (or `Contract source code already verified`). Without an Etherscan key, replace `--etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` with `--verifier sourcify`. Expected then: `Contract successfully verified`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Log and commit**

Append under `## Contracts (plan 01)`:
```markdown
- **Sepolia contracts verified** (tETH, tUSD, live RiskDesk, live ClimHook): source readable on Etherscan for the judges.
```
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md && git commit -m "docs(sessions): Sepolia contracts verified"
```

### Task 18: Replay suite on Sepolia (P1)

**Delegable:** no
**Depends on:** Task 16; plan 02 Task 2 (the `cre/` folder exists). Its own desk is fed by plan 02's replay mode (`riskDesks.replay`). Run it while no CRE loop is running (Step 1 sends from the deployer key).

**Files:**
- Create: `cre/.env.replay` (never committed: the root `.gitignore` ignores `.env.*`), `contracts/deployments/11155111/{desk,hook,pools,liquidity}-replay.json`
- Modify: `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create and fund the replay operator key**

The replay desk gets its own `simOperator`, so the live and replay CRE loops (both running for hours) never send from the same key and never race for a nonce. `simOperator` is immutable per desk, which is why this happens before the deployment. The key is written without being printed (only its address is shown) and funded with 0.2 Sepolia ETH from the deployer: one report every 30 s for the 4.5 h of the replay costs about 0.1 ETH at 1 gwei.
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && test -d cre && { test -f cre/.env.replay || { K=$(cast wallet new --json | jq -r '.[0].private_key'); printf '# Replay desk operator (simOperator of riskDesks.replay, plan 01 Task 18). Testnet only, never committed.\nCRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=%s\nSEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com\n' "${K#0x}" > cre/.env.replay; }; } && git check-ignore -q cre/.env.replay && echo IGNORED_OK && \
R=$(cast wallet address --private-key "0x$(grep '^CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=' cre/.env.replay | cut -d= -f2)") && echo "replay operator $R" && \
cd contracts && set -a && source .env && set +a && cast send "$R" --value 0.2ether --private-key "$PRIVATE_KEY" --rpc-url "$SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" | grep -E "^status" && cast balance "$R" --rpc-url "$SEPOLIA_RPC_URL" --ether
```
Expected: `IGNORED_OK`, `replay operator 0x<address>`, `status               1 (success)`, then `0.200000000000000000` (or more if the address already held ETH).

- [ ] **Step 2: Deploy the replay suite at the replay window's first price, with the replay operator as `simOperator`**

The replay window starts at 2026-02-04 12:00 UTC, which is 1770206400000 ms; its first Binance close was $2,254.
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && export SIM_OPERATOR=$(cast wallet address --private-key "0x$(grep '^CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=' ../cre/.env.replay | cut -d= -f2)") && echo "SIM_OPERATOR=$SIM_OPERATOR" && \
export INIT_ETH_USD=$(curl -s "https://data-api.binance.vision/api/v3/klines?symbol=ETHUSDT&interval=1m&startTime=1770206400000&limit=1" | jq -r '.[0][1] | tonumber | floor') && echo "INIT_ETH_USD=$INIT_ETH_USD" && \
ok(){ out=$("$@" 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -E "ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE|Error" || echo "$out" | grep -E "Script ran successfully"; ! echo "$out" | grep -q "Error"; } && \
F=0; for s in 01_DeployDesk 02_DeployHook 03_CreatePools 04_AddLiquidity; do SUITE=replay ok forge script script/$s.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --slow || { F=1; break; }; done; [ $F = 0 ] && \
ok forge script script/05_WriteDeployments.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia && \
cast call $(jq -r .riskDesks.replay ../shared/deployments/sepolia.json) "state()(uint40,uint32,uint16,uint8,uint32)" --rpc-url sepolia && \
cast call $(jq -r .riskDesks.replay ../shared/deployments/sepolia.json) "simOperator()(address)" --rpc-url sepolia
```
Expected: `SIM_OPERATOR=0x<replay operator>`, `INIT_ETH_USD=2254`, four `ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE & SUCCESSFUL.` lines, `Script ran successfully.`, then `0 0 0 2 0` (REPLAY flag), then the replay operator address again. `cast` resolves the `sepolia` alias from `foundry.toml` and reads `.env` itself. Plan 02 Task 12 and plan 04's `cre-loop --pair replay` send the replay reports with `cre/.env.replay` (`ENV_FILE=.env.replay`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Log and commit**

Append under `## Contracts (plan 01)`:
```markdown
- **Replay suite deployed on Sepolia:** desk flagged REPLAY with its own operator key (`cre/.env.replay`, simOperator <address>), its own hook, V and S initialized at the replay window's first price (Binance ETHUSDT 2026-02-04 12:00 UTC).
```
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add contracts/deployments/11155111 contracts/broadcast shared/deployments/sepolia.json docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md && git commit -m "deploy(contracts): replay suite on Sepolia"
```

### Task 19: DON desk on Sepolia (only when plan 02 Task 13 asks for it)

**Delegable:** no
**Depends on:** Task 16, and plan 02 having deploy access to a CRE DON

**Files:**
- Create: `contracts/deployments/11155111/desk-don.json`
- Modify: `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`

- [ ] **Step 1: Deploy the DON desk (production forwarder; simulation mode is switched off in the same broadcast)**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/contracts && ok(){ out=$("$@" 2>&1); echo "$out" | grep -E "ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE|Error" || echo "$out" | grep -E "Script ran successfully"; ! echo "$out" | grep -q "Error"; } && SUITE=don ok forge script script/01_DeployDesk.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia --broadcast --slow && ok forge script script/05_WriteDeployments.s.sol --rpc-url sepolia && cat deployments/11155111/desk-don.json
```
Expected: `ONCHAIN EXECUTION COMPLETE & SUCCESSFUL.`, `Script ran successfully.`, and a fragment with `"forwarder": "0xF8344CFd5c43616a4366C34E3EEE75af79a74482"` and `"simMode": false`. `riskDesks.don` is now set in `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`. Plan 02's later `cast send <don desk> "disableSim()"` is then a harmless no-op.

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add contracts/deployments/11155111/desk-don.json contracts/broadcast shared/deployments/sepolia.json && git commit -m "deploy(contracts): DON RiskDesk on the production KeystoneForwarder"
```

Not covered here, on purpose: the CRE workflow (plan 02), bots (plan 04), the lab decision (plan 03), the dashboard (plan 05) and `docs/faq.md` and the README (plan 06).

**2. Placeholder scan.**
- No "TBD", "TODO", "implement later" or "similar to Task N".
- Every code step contains the complete file: the generator inserted the exact files that compiled and passed.
- The only angle-bracket tokens are `<next>` in friction-log rows (the next free row number, unknowable in advance), `<now>` in an expected smoke output (the fork's block time), and the `deployer` description inside the example JSON schema. None of them is in a source file.

**3. Type and name consistency.** These names are identical across the contracts, tests, scripts, the deployments JSON and plans 02/04:
- `state()` returns `(tObs, sigmaE9, kE4, flags, seq)`, the same names as plan 04's ABI fragments;
- `quoteFee()` returns `(fee, mode)`;
- `RiskReported` has 11 fields in canonical order;
- `FLAG_DEGRADED` = 1, `FLAG_REPLAY` = 2; `MODE_NORMAL` = 0, `MODE_DEGRADED` = 1, `MODE_BLIND` = 2;
- the constructor `(IPoolManager, IRiskDesk, uint32 etaE4, uint32 sqrtHalfDtE6, uint24 feeMinPips, uint24 feeMaxPips, uint24 feeSafePips, uint32 tauKillSec)` matches `HookHelpers._hookArgs`, `02_DeployHook._args` and Task 17's `cast abi-encode`;
- `mint(address to, uint256 amount)`, `faucet()`, `faucetAmount()`, `lastFaucetAt(address)`, `FaucetCooldown(uint256 nextAt)`;
- the JSON keys `riskDesks.*`, `hooks.*`, `pools.{liveV,liveS,replayV,replayS}.{key,poolId,token0IsEth}` and `tokens.*.address`.

**Known differences that other plans must absorb** (also listed in the orchestrator hand-off):
- Resolved in the plan 00 integration pass: plan 02's `sync-config.ts` reads `riskDesks.*` and `tokens.tETH.address` (this plan's schema); the lab (plan 03) writes `staticFeePips` and `replayStaticFeePips` to `shared/params.json`; `routers.arb` is deployed by `00_Tokens` (plans 04 and 05).
- etaE4 is 25,093 at P\* = 30 % in every test and fixture of this plan (rounded constant 0.824, spec §2.3); the Integration story's third storm step is therefore 4,203 pips (it was 4,204 with 25,094).
