# clim Frontend (Dashboard) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

> **Execution status (read first; fixer pass, 2026-10-06).** Tasks 1 to 24 of this plan, plus the Frontend scope upgrade decided by the maintainer (wallet connect, core `/swap` and `/lp` pages, session log 2026-10-06), were executed after kickoff in the private repository DVB-ANS/clim-front (local clone `/Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim-front`, its root is this plan's `app/`, first commit 2026-10-06 20:24 SGT). Its own `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` records the deviations from the code below: design tokens instead of raw Tailwind colours, wagmi 2.19.5 + RainbowKit 2.2.11 + TanStack Query 5 (the "viem only" choice is reversed), `CLIM_ROOT` for `npm run sync`, `/swap` and `/lp` with a simulated mode until the live pair exists. The dashboard is live at https://clim-zeta.vercel.app (Vercel project `clim`, mock data until Gate B).
> In the clim repository: **do not re-run Tasks 1 to 24.** Master plan Task 14 imports clim-front into `app/` with `git subtree` (history kept, so the commit dates stay visible), then runs Task 28 (post-import fixes from the plan review), Task 25 (wire to Sepolia), Task 27 (check `/swap` and `/lp` on Sepolia) and Task 26 (freeze). Tasks 1 to 24 stay below as the reference of what the app does. After the import, the app changes only in `clim/app/`. **Status 2026-10-07:** imported at clim-front `d05ee94` (subtree `758ab5a`); Tasks 1 to 24 are ticked from clim-front's history (each task names its commit and what differs today), Tasks 25 to 28 were done in clim, and the live URL reads Sepolia.

**Goal:** A basic but functional public dashboard (live URL on Vercel) that shows how clim computes its fee from the Chainlink CRE risk desk, compares the clim pool V with its static twin S from on-chain logs, checks the model's arbitrage-frequency prediction, and presents the lab's Feb 4 2026 replay and backtests; restyled later.

**Architecture:** Next.js App Router app in `app/`, fully static pages with client-side data loading. All chain data comes from logs (`RiskDesk.RiskReported`, `PoolManager.Swap`, forwarder `ReportProcessed`) fetched with viem through public Sepolia RPCs in 5,000-block chunks, then turned into series by pure, unit-tested functions (`app/src/lib/*`). Before the contracts exist, a deterministic mock chain produces ABI-encoded logs that go through the same decoders, so switching to Sepolia changes only the data source. `npm run sync` copies `shared/` (addresses, hook parameters), `lab/out/*.json` and `docs/faq.md` into `app/` (fixtures fill the gaps), so Vercel builds `app/` on its own.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 16.3.8 (Turbopack), React 19.2, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4, Recharts 3.10.1, viem 2.57.3, wagmi 2.19.5 + @rainbow-me/rainbowkit 2.2.11 + @tanstack/react-query 5 (wallet, added by the Frontend scope upgrade in clim-front), react-markdown 10.1 + remark-gfm 4, Vitest 5.0.3, tsx 4.23 (scripts), Vercel CLI.

---

## Conventions (read once)

- **Working directory.** Every command runs from the repository root (`/Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim`). Commands that run inside the app are written `(cd app && …)`.
- **Hackathon rule.** All code in this plan is written after the hackathon kickoff (rule in `CLAUDE.md`). It was drafted and validated in a throwaway scratch project the same day; it is typed into the repo by executing this plan.
- **Living document.** If reality differs (a version, an address, a schema chosen by another plan), change the code, update this plan in the same commit, and add one line to today's session log (`docs/sessions/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`, same headings as `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`).
- **Docs and UI text are in English.** No secrets anywhere in `app/`: the only env vars are `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` testnet settings.
- **Never edit generated files by hand:** `app/src/generated/*` and `app/public/data/lab/*` are written by `npm run sync`, `app/src/fixtures/lab/*` by `npm run fixtures`, `app/public/data/chain/*` by `npm run snapshot`. All of them are committed (Vercel builds from the committed tree).
- **Why these libraries.**
  - *Recharts 3*: declarative React components with what the key picture needs out of the box (step lines `type="stepAfter"`, synced tooltips across stacked charts with `syncId`, range areas for the model band, `ReferenceArea` for blind-mode shading, scatter dots on the same axes). After downsampling, series stay under 1,500 points, which SVG handles. Rejected: uPlot (faster canvas but imperative, needs a hand-written React wrapper), TradingView lightweight-charts (time axis only, cannot draw fee against σ), visx (too low-level for the time we have).
  - *wagmi 2 + RainbowKit* (reversed from the first "viem only" choice by the Frontend scope upgrade): `/swap` and `/lp` are core pages for judges with any wallet. RainbowKit 2.2.11 supports wagmi 2 only (not wagmi 3), so the app pins wagmi 2.19.5 on the same viem 2.57.3; injected wallets work without a WalletConnect project id, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID` adds WalletConnect-based wallets (clim-front session log, "Wallet stack").
- **Charts follow one color per entity on every chart** (V blue `#2a78d6`, S orange `#eb6834`, σ aqua `#1baf7a`, secondary series gray), never two y-axes (the σ chart and the fee chart are stacked with a shared time axis), status colors only with an icon and a label.

## Dependencies on other plans (gates)

| Needs | From | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| nothing | | Tasks 1 to 24: everything runs on fixtures and the mock chain |
| `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` with the live desk, hook, pools, `deployBlock` and `routers.arb`; `shared/abis/RiskDesk.json`, `shared/abis/ClimHook.json` | plan 01 (contracts; file created by plan 04) | Task 25 |
| `shared/params.json` (the P\* decision) | plan 03 (lab), written before the hook is deployed | Task 25 |
| `lab/out/summary.json`, `lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json` (the replay file is read by plan 06 too), `lab/out/ptrade-band.json` (shapes fixed here and written by plan 03's Tasks 17, 19, 20) | plan 03 (lab) | Task 25 |
| RiskReported events flowing every 30 s; arbitrage and retail bots swapping on V and S | plans 02 and 04 | Tasks 25 and 26 |
| `docs/faq.md` (already in the repo) | plan 00 / 06 | Task 13 (sync) |
| The live URL and screenshots of the weather chart | consumed by plan 06 (README, deck) | Tasks 24 and 26 |

## Interfaces this plan consumes (reconcile here first)

These are the exact shapes the app parses. If another plan writes a different shape, change only the named parser and its test fixture, then log the change.

1. **`shared/deployments/sepolia.json`** in the shape fixed by plan 04 (its "Contracts with other plans" §1 and Task 6), parsed by `parseDeployments` in `app/src/lib/deployments.ts` (Task 6), which maps it to the app's own `Deployments` / `PairDeployment` types (so only this parser changes if the file changes):
   - `chainId` 11155111; `deployBlock` (number, required once a pair is deployed: log scans start there); `uniswap.{poolManager,stateView,poolSwapTest,poolModifyLiquidityTest}`; `cre.{mockForwarder,keystoneForwarder}`;
   - `tokens.tETH` / `tokens.tUSD`: `{ address, symbol, decimals }` or null;
   - `riskDesks.{live,replay}`, `hooks.{live,replay}`: address or null;
   - `pools.{liveV,liveS,replayV,replayS}`: `{ key: { currency0, currency1, fee, tickSpacing, hooks }, poolId, token0IsEth }` or null. The parser recomputes `poolId = keccak256(abi.encode(key))` and throws on a mismatch;
   - plan 01 adds `deployer`, `riskDesks.don` and `liquidity`, which the app ignores;
   - **one addition requested by this plan:** `"routers": { "arb": "<address>" }` (see 2).

   A pair (`live` or `replay`) is used once its desk, hook and both pools are non-null; until then the dashboard runs on mock data.
2. **Arbitrage identification (implemented in plans 01 and 04 by the plan 00 integration pass).** A swap counts as arbitrage when `Swap.sender == routers.arb`. `Swap.sender` is the contract that called `PoolManager.swap`, i.e. the router; plan 04 currently sends both the arbitrage and the retail swaps through the canonical PoolSwapTest, which makes them indistinguishable from logs. Implemented: plan 01's `00_Tokens` deploys a second `PoolSwapTest` (`new PoolSwapTest(IPoolManager(poolManager))`, v4-core `src/test/PoolSwapTest.sol`) and `05_WriteDeployments` records it as `routers.arb`; plan 04's arbitrage bot (`fund.ts` approvals and `arb.ts` swaps) uses `routers.arb` instead of `uniswap.poolSwapTest`, and nothing else uses it. This keeps the design's promise that the attribution is recomputable from logs alone. Until `routers.arb` exists, the Validation and P&L panels say so instead of showing numbers.
3. **Arbitrage valuation.** `pnlExplain` (Task 10) recovers the arbitrageur's reference price from the post-swap price, because plan 04's bot pushes the pool exactly to the edge of the no-arbitrage band `[m(1 - f), m / (1 - f)]` with an exact-input swap whose price limit binds: `m = P_after / (1 - f)` after a buy of ETH, `m = P_after · (1 - f)` after a sale.
4. **`shared/params.json`** (spec §2.6): `pStar, etaE4, sqrtHalfDtE6, feeMinPips, feeMaxPips, feeSafePips, tauKillSec, decidedBy`, parsed by `parseParams` (Task 6). The lab also writes `staticFeePips`, `replayStaticFeePips` and `decidedAt`; the parser ignores them.
5. **`shared/abis/RiskDesk.json`, `shared/abis/ClimHook.json`**: a bare ABI array or a Foundry artifact with an `abi` key. Task 4's drift test checks the hand-written fragments against them when they exist.
6. **Lab outputs** (typed and parsed in `app/src/lib/lab.ts`, Task 7), written by plan 03 exactly in these shapes (its "Output contracts"). `summary.json` is the app's condensed view of the same numbers plan 06 reads from `backtest-summary.json`; `replay-2026-02-04.json` is one file that carries both plan 06's `points[]` and the columnar arrays below, so the README, the deck and the dashboard show the same numbers:
   - `lab/out/summary.json`: `generatedAt`, `setting {pStar, feeMinPips}`, `comparisons {equalAvgFee[], equalTraderCost[]}` of `{period, arbChangePct}`, `pTrade[]` of `{period, predicted, observed, blocks}`, `replay {window, sigmaMinPct, sigmaMaxPct, feeVMinBp, feeVMaxBp, feeSBp, arbChangePct, arbChangeRangePct[2], pTradePredicted, pTradeObserved}`, `lpGain {fullRangeEthPctPerYear[2], volatileAssetPctPerYearMax, shareFromTop5WeeksPct}`, `modelSeverityRatio[2]`, `inPoolVolGainSharePct[2]`;
   - `lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json`: `{ window {startUtc, endUtc}, t[], sigmaAnnualPct[], feeVBp[], feeSBp, arbCumVUsd[], arbCumSUsd[] }`, arrays of equal length, plus an **optional** `price[]` (ETH/USD) that the app draws when present (requested from plan 03);
   - `lab/out/ptrade-band.json`, **defined by this plan** for plan 03: `{ generatedAt, windowBlocks: 300, method, grid: [{ p, lo95, hi95, lo99, hi99 }] }`, `grid` ascending in `p`: for a predicted per-block frequency `p`, the 2.5/97.5% and 0.5/99.5% quantiles of the observed frequency over `windowBlocks` blocks, simulated with the clustered arbitrage of spec §7.3.

   Fractions for P_trade and `pStar`, percent for every `*Pct` field, bp for fees. If plan 03 writes other shapes, the reconciliation edits `lab.ts`, its test and `scripts/make-fixtures.ts`.
7. **Events** (verified on Sepolia): `Swap(bytes32 indexed id, address indexed sender, int128 amount0, int128 amount1, uint160 sqrtPriceX96, uint128 liquidity, int24 tick, uint24 fee)`, topic `0x40e9cecb…7112f`, where amount0/amount1 are the **swapper's** deltas (negative = paid into the pool) despite the natspec; `ReportProcessed(address indexed receiver, bytes32 indexed workflowExecutionId, bytes2 indexed reportId, bool result)`, topic `0x3617b009…16b5`; `RiskReported` as in spec §3.5. `zone`: 0 not evaluated, 1 green, 2 yellow, 3 red.
8. **TestToken** (plan 01 Task 7): `faucet()` with no argument, public, 10 tETH or 25,000 tUSD per address once per hour (`FaucetCooldown(uint256 nextAt)` otherwise); `mint` stays owner-only. `/lp` calls `faucet()` on both tokens; Task 28 adds `faucetAmount()`, `lastFaucetAt(address)` and the error to `testTokenAbi`.
9. **Workspace (plan 04 contract §9, declined on purpose).** Plan 04 proposes adding `app` to the root Bun workspace and importing `@clim/shared`. This plan keeps `app/` a standalone npm project that Vercel deploys on its own: `npm run sync` copies the JSON sources of truth (`shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, `shared/params.json`, `lab/out/*.json`, `docs/faq.md`) into `app/`, and the few TypeScript helpers the app needs (`feePips`/`quoteFee`, unit conversions, ABI fragments) are small ports checked against the same test vectors (spec §2.4, plan 04 §3) and, for ABIs, against `shared/abis/*.json` (Task 4). Reason: a Vercel deployment of a Bun monorepo with a transpiled workspace package could not be validated here, while this layout was built and tested end to end. Do not add `"app"` to the root `workspaces`. A root `package.json` + `bun.lock` above `app/` was tested: `next build` in `app/` is unaffected.

## File structure

All paths are under `app/`. The Frontend scope upgrade added, in clim-front: `src/lib/{wallet,swap,liquidity,tx}.ts` (wagmi config, swap planning, full-range position math and fees owed, transaction steps) with their tests, `src/hooks/{useTxFlow,useChainSteps,useLpState,useStored}.ts`, `src/components/{WalletProviders,WalletButton,SwapForm,LiquidityBoard,LiquidityForm,PositionPanel,FaucetCard,TxSteps,TxModeSwitch}.tsx` and the pages `src/app/swap/page.tsx` and `src/app/lp/page.tsx`. Task 28 adds `src/lib/labText.ts` (rounded lab numbers, dollars per $1M, the replay-window note) and its test. clim-front also split the routes into two groups: `src/app/(site)/page.tsx` is the landing at `/`, and `src/app/(app)/{app,replay,lab,how,swap,lp,credits}/page.tsx` share the app header of `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`, so the dashboard is at `/app`.

### Task 1: Scaffold the Next.js app

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `7f416ef`. Differences: the root `src/app/layout.tsx` now loads the fonts, `WalletProviders` and `MotionProvider`, and the nav lives in `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` (`AppHeader.tsx`); the Task 1 home stub became the landing `src/app/(site)/page.tsx`; colours are design tokens in `globals.css`; `.env.example` also has `NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID`; `app/README.md` is a later README (`c924078`, how to run and go live), not the scaffold's. The Step 7 line is in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` ("Frontend build log"), marked as superseded for "viem only".

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** nothing

**Files:**
- Create: `app/` (create-next-app), `app/vitest.config.mts`, `app/.env.example`, `app/src/lib/smoke.test.ts`
- Modify: `app/package.json` (deps, scripts), `app/tsconfig.json` (target), `app/.gitignore`, `app/src/app/layout.tsx`, `app/src/app/globals.css`, `app/src/app/page.tsx`
- Delete: `app/public/*.svg`, `app/README.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Create the app**

```bash
npx -y create-next-app@16.3.8 app --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --use-npm --disable-git --no-react-compiler --yes
```
Expected: ends with `Success! Created app at /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/app`. It pins `next` 16.3.8 and `react` 19.2.8 and writes `app/AGENTS.md` + `app/CLAUDE.md` (Next.js agent rules: keep them). If the install step fails with `ETIMEDOUT`, run `(cd app && npm install --fetch-retries=5 --fetch-timeout=180000)`.

- [x] **Step 2: Add the dependencies**

```bash
(cd app && npm install --fetch-retries=5 viem@2.57.3 recharts@3.10.1 react-markdown@10.1.0 remark-gfm@4.0.1)
(cd app && npm install -D --fetch-retries=5 @types/node@^22 vitest@5.0.3 tsx@4.23.15)
```
Expected: both end with `found 0 vulnerabilities` or an audit summary, no `ERESOLVE`. (`@types/node` must move from ^20 to ^22: Vitest 5 declares the peer `@types/node ^22 || >=24`, and npm refuses the install otherwise.)

- [x] **Step 3: Scripts, TypeScript target, cleanup**

```bash
(cd app && npm pkg set name=clim-app scripts.typecheck="tsc --noEmit" scripts.test="vitest run" scripts.sync="node scripts/sync-data.mjs" scripts.fixtures="tsx scripts/make-fixtures.ts" scripts.snapshot="tsx scripts/snapshot.ts")
sed -i '' 's/"target": "ES2017"/"target": "ES2020"/' app/tsconfig.json
rm app/public/*.svg app/README.md
printf '\n!.env.example\n' >> app/.gitignore
printf 'NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_CLIM_SOURCE=\n' > app/.env.example
```
ES2020 is required for bigint literals (`10n`) under `tsc`. The `.gitignore` line re-includes `.env.example`, which the scaffold's `.env*` rule would hide.

- [x] **Step 4: Vitest config and a smoke test**

Create `app/vitest.config.mts`:

```ts
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: {
    alias: { "@": fileURLToPath(new URL("./src", import.meta.url)) },
  },
  test: {
    environment: "node",
    include: ["src/**/*.test.ts", "scripts/**/*.test.ts"],
  },
});
```

Create `app/src/lib/smoke.test.ts`:

```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";

describe("toolchain", () => {
  it("runs vitest with bigint support", () => {
    expect(2n ** 64n).toBe(18446744073709551616n);
  });
});
```

- [x] **Step 5: Replace the scaffold's layout, styles and home page**

The scaffold's `layout.tsx` uses the `LayoutProps` global that only exists after `next build`/`next dev` typegen, so `npm run typecheck` fails on a fresh clone; the version below does not need it.

Create (overwrite) `app/src/app/layout.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";
import Link from "next/link";
import "./globals.css";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "clim: storm insurance for Uniswap v4 LPs",
  description: "A Chainlink CRE risk desk publishes ETH volatility on-chain; a Uniswap v4 hook turns it into the LP fee on every swap.",
};

const NAV = [
  { href: "/", label: "Dashboard" },
  { href: "/replay", label: "Replay" },
  { href: "/lab", label: "Lab" },
  { href: "/how", label: "How it works" },
];

export default function RootLayout({ children }: Readonly<{ children: ReactNode }>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className="min-h-screen">
        <header className="border-b border-black/10 bg-white">
          <nav className="mx-auto flex max-w-6xl items-center gap-6 px-4 py-3">
            <Link href="/" className="text-lg font-bold">clim</Link>
            {NAV.map((n) => (
              <Link key={n.href} href={n.href} className="text-sm text-neutral-700 hover:text-black">{n.label}</Link>
            ))}
            <span className="ml-auto text-xs text-neutral-500">Ethereum Sepolia · Chainlink CRE · Uniswap v4</span>
          </nav>
        </header>
        <main className="mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4 py-6">{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Create (overwrite) `app/src/app/globals.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

:root {
  --background: #f9f9f7;
  --foreground: #0b0b0b;
}

@theme inline {
  --color-background: var(--background);
  --color-foreground: var(--foreground);
}

body {
  background: var(--background);
  color: var(--foreground);
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
}
```

Create (overwrite) `app/src/app/page.tsx` (replaced by the dashboard in Task 20):

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">clim</h1>;
}
```

- [x] **Step 6: Run every check**

```bash
(cd app && npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build)
```
Expected: `Tests  1 passed (1)`; `tsc` and `eslint` print nothing; the build ends with the route table `○ /` and `○ /_not-found` marked `(Static)`.

- [x] **Step 7: Log the decision**

Append under `## Decisions` in today's session log:

```markdown
- **Frontend stack (plan 05):** Next.js 16.3.8 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19.2, Tailwind 4, Recharts 3.10 for charts, viem 2.57 only (no wagmi: the optional test-swap page needs one injected wallet), Vitest 5 for the pure transforms. `npm run sync` copies shared/, lab/out and docs/faq.md into app/, so Vercel builds app/ alone.
```

- [x] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add app docs/sessions
git commit -m "chore(app): scaffold Next.js 16 dashboard with vitest"
```

### Task 2: Unit conversions and formatters

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `74c7686`. `units.test.ts` has 9 tests today (7 at this commit; `5cd934f` added the amount formatters).

### Task 4: ABI fragments and event topics

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `e0c244e`. Today `abis.test.ts` has 10 tests and none skipped: `shared/abis/` exists, so the drift guards run, and the liquidity, position and faucet fragments came with `7920998` and Task 28.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 1

The expected values were read on Sepolia on 2026-10-06: the Swap topic from PoolManager logs, the `swap` selector `0x2229d0b4` in the bytecode of PoolSwapTest `0x9b6b…6eee`, and the ReportProcessed topic from MockKeystoneForwarder `0x15fC…9F88` logs.

### Task 6: Deployments and parameters parsers

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `125ec6e`.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 3

The parser reads the schema plan 04 fixed for `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` (interface 1) and maps it to the app's own types. `computePoolId` is checked against a real Sepolia pool (its `Initialize` log at block `0xb45c6c`).

**Files:**
- Create: `app/src/lib/deployments.ts`

### Task 7: Lab output schemas

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `0e861c8`. The Step 5 line is in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` ("Frontend build log").

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 1

This task fixes how the app reads the lab outputs (interface 6). `summary.json`, the columnar part of `replay-2026-02-04.json` and `ptrade-band.json` are the shapes plan 03 writes (its "Output contracts" and `lab/tests/test_outputs.py`); the fixtures below are synthetic. Units: `t` unix seconds, σ annualised in %, fees in bp, cumulative ARB in USD, P_trade and `pStar` as fractions, every `*Pct` in % (negative = V loses less to arbitrage).

### Task 8: Weather series (σ and the fee it sets)

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `692b5c5`.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 3, 5

The fee is a step function of time rebuilt from logs only: it changes when a report is **included** (block time, not tObs), and goes blind at `tObs + tauKillSec + 1` if no newer report has landed. Historical DEGRADED flags are re-derived from `dispBp > 25` (RiskDesk clears or sets the flag on every report, spec §3.5). `dvolE2 = 0` means DVOL was unavailable (plan 02), so it is drawn as a gap, not as 0%.

### Task 9: P_trade, predicted against observed

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `577c005`. The Step 5 line is in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` ("Frontend build log").

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 7, 8

Predicted per block (spec §7.1): `1 / (f / (σ̂·√(Δt/2)) + 0.824)` with the fee actually in force (dynamic pool) or the static fee (S). Observed: share of blocks with at least one swap whose `sender` is the arbitrage router. Rolling window: the lab band's `windowBlocks` (300).

### Task 10: LP P&L explain and swap rows

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `981e307`.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 5

Valuing arbitrage swaps at the desk's refTick would be biased: the refTick is 30 to 90 s old, and an arbitrageur buys right after the price went up, so a stale price systematically understates its profit. The arbitrageur's own price is recovered exactly from the post-swap price, using plan 04's band edges `[m(1 - f), m / (1 - f)]` (interface 3). The same module turns swaps into the rows of the recent-swaps table (side, size, fee paid, arbitrage or retail).

### Task 11: Chain data layer (RPCs, chunked logs, snapshot schema)

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `177cc55`. The Step 5 line is in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` ("Frontend build log", Surprises).

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 5, 6

Measured on 2026-10-06 (and the snapshot script of Task 23 was run against real Sepolia logs: 35 swaps of an existing pool and 3 rejected `ReportProcessed` deliveries to an existing receiver in 3,000 blocks): `https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com` answers `eth_getLogs` only for about the last 10,000 blocks (`4444 pruned history unavailable`) and caps ranges at 50,000 blocks; `https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co` serves full history (20,000 blocks of PoolManager logs in 4 chunks of 5,000 took about 9 s). Both return `blockTimestamp` in logs and allow CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`). viem's `fallback` transport moves to the next RPC on these errors.

Six hours of 12 s blocks: a calm 35% regime, a storm peaking at 180% (55% of the run), a degraded window (venues disagree, 30 to 32%), a cut CRE loop (no reports, 85 to 87%, so the hook goes blind), one forged report rejected by the forwarder (70%), mirrored retail flow, and an arbitrageur that pushes each pool to the edge of its band `[m(1 - f), m / (1 - f)]` like plan 04's bot. L = 2e23 (about $20M TVL) and retail orders of about $500 keep retail price impact below the 5 bp floor; with $3k orders on $2M the observed P_trade was 0.64 against 0.20 predicted, because every retail trade then creates an arbitrage.

Append under `## Surprises` in today's session log:

```markdown
- **Retail noise inflates observed P_trade (plan 05 mock):** retail orders whose price impact approaches the fee floor create extra arbitrage blocks ($3k orders on $2M of full-range TVL: observed 0.64 vs predicted 0.20; $500 orders on $20M: 0.21 vs 0.195). Plan 01's pool depth (100,000 tETH per pool, L about 5.2e24: a $2,000 order moves the price about 0.15 bp) keeps this effect small; keep it that way, or the live validation chart will look wrong for a reason unrelated to the model.

## How is the fee computed?

No transaction ever "changes" the fee. On every swap, the Uniswap v4 PoolManager calls the hook's `beforeSwap`. The hook reads the latest volatility from `RiskDesk.state()`, computes `fee = clamp(eta * sigma * sqrt(blockTime / 2) * k, floor, cap)` and returns it with `OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG`. The Chainlink CRE risk desk updates sigma on-chain every 30 seconds through `onReport`.

## Can a pool that is already live change its fee?

- A v4 pool's fee mode and hook are part of its `PoolKey`, and the pool id is the hash of that key. An existing static-fee pool can never become dynamic or gain a hook: you create a new pool and migrate liquidity.
- A dynamic-fee pool (fee field `0x800000`) can change its LP fee at any time, but only through its hook: either per swap, by returning a fee with `OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG` from `beforeSwap` (what clim does), or by storing a new fee with `PoolManager.updateDynamicLPFee`, which reverts unless the caller is the pool's hook.
- clim's own parameters (P\*, floor, cap) are immutable: changing them means a new hook and a new pool.
- A DEX that already runs dynamic fees can integrate the desk without a new pool: its hook or keeper reads `RiskDesk.state()`.

_This is the fixture FAQ shipped with the app. The full FAQ lives in `docs/faq.md`; `npm run sync` copies it here._

### Task 14: Lab fixtures, first sync, config modules

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `f289f29`. Today every source reads `repo` (`npm run sync` at `d05ee94`, session log 2026-10-07) and the suite is 24 files, 211 tests (21 and 170 at the import; the timeWindow, faq and ledger tests were added on 2026-10-07 in `e9aab85`, `3d0ae57` and `4dedb1b`, and 6 ledger and story tests in `c2ef0e5`, then net +1 in audit round 3 (a story test in `080884f`, the sqrtPriceOf test removed in `c9347f4`, a FAQ order test in `2dca157`)).

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 7, 12, 13

The lab fixtures are **synthetic** and labeled as such in every title (`Synthetic storm (fixture)`, `Synthetic A (fixture)`), so no number can be mistaken for a lab result in a screenshot.

**Files:**
- Create: `app/scripts/make-fixtures.ts`, `app/src/lib/config.ts`, `app/src/lib/labData.ts`

```

- [x] **Step 2: Generate the fixtures and run the first sync**

```bash
(cd app && npm run fixtures && npm run sync)
```
Expected: `wrote src/fixtures/lab/{replay-2026-02-04,ptrade-band,summary}.json`, then a table with six rows. `src/generated/faq.ts` shows `repo` (docs/faq.md exists); the other five show `fixture` until plans 01 and 03 deliver. The replay fixture is about 50 KB (1,200 points, columnar).

- [x] **Step 3: Config modules**

Create `app/src/lib/config.ts`:

```ts
import rawParams from "@/generated/params.json";
import rawDeployments from "@/generated/sepolia.json";
import { type Pair, parseDeployments, parseParams } from "./deployments";

// src/generated/* is written by `npm run sync` from shared/ (or from src/fixtures/ until shared/ exists).
export const deployments = parseDeployments(rawDeployments);
export const params = parseParams(rawParams);

export const EXPLORER = "https://sepolia.etherscan.io";

export type DataSource = "mock" | "sepolia";

/** Mock until the pair is deployed; NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIM_SOURCE=mock forces mock data. */
export function dataSource(pair: Pair, forced: string | undefined = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIM_SOURCE): DataSource {
  if (forced === "mock") return "mock";
  return deployments.pairs[pair] ? "sepolia" : "mock";
}
```

Create `app/src/lib/labData.ts`:

```ts
import band from "../../public/data/lab/ptrade-band.json";
import replay from "../../public/data/lab/replay-2026-02-04.json";
import summary from "../../public/data/lab/summary.json";
import { parsePTradeBand, parseReplay, parseSummary } from "./lab";

// public/data/lab/* is written by `npm run sync` from lab/out (or src/fixtures/lab until the lab runs).
// The same files are served at /data/lab/*.json so anyone can download the numbers behind the charts.
// Server components only: importing this module in a client component would ship the replay to the browser.
export const labSummary = parseSummary(summary);
export const labReplay = parseReplay(replay);
export const labBand = parsePTradeBand(band);
```

- [x] **Step 4: Run every check**

```bash
(cd app && npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint)
```
Expected: `Test Files  13 passed (13)`, `Tests  91 passed | 2 skipped (93)`; `tsc` and `eslint` print nothing.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add app/scripts/make-fixtures.ts app/src/lib/config.ts app/src/lib/labData.ts app/src/fixtures/lab app/src/generated app/public/data/lab
git commit -m "feat(app): synthetic lab fixtures, first data sync, config modules"
```

### Task 15: Theme, UI primitives and the data hook

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `9ec11b4`. `theme.ts` maps the series and modes to CSS variables (design tokens) instead of the Conventions' raw colours; today V is Chainlink Blue, S gray (dashed), σ Uniswap pink (session log 2026-10-07, "Frontend build log"); `ui.tsx` also exports `Toggle`.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 11, 14

`useClimData(pair)` is the only place that knows where data comes from. Mock: regenerate the mock world every 30 s (same seed, so the picture is stable and the desk never looks stale). Sepolia: load `/data/chain/<pair>.json` if present, then read state and fetch logs from the next block, every 12 s, never two loads at once.

**Files:**
- Create: `app/src/lib/theme.ts`, `app/src/components/ui.tsx`, `app/src/hooks/useClimData.ts`

- [x] **Step 1: Theme**

Create `app/src/lib/theme.ts`:

```ts
import { FeeMode } from "./feeMath";

// Dataviz reference palette (light): one color per entity, the same on every chart.
export const COLORS = {
  V: "#2a78d6", // clim pool (dynamic fee), categorical slot 1
  S: "#eb6834", // static twin pool, slot 2
  sigma: "#1baf7a", // desk volatility, slot 3
  muted: "#898781", // secondary series (DVOL, reported sigma), axes
  grid: "#e1e0d9",
  band: "#cde2fb", // P_trade simulated band (sequential blue step 100)
} as const;

export const MODE_STYLE: Record<FeeMode, { label: string; icon: string; color: string }> = {
  [FeeMode.Normal]: { label: "Normal", icon: "●", color: "#0ca30c" },
  [FeeMode.Degraded]: { label: "Degraded", icon: "▲", color: "#fab219" },
  [FeeMode.Blind]: { label: "Blind", icon: "■", color: "#d03b3b" },
};

/** Deterministic UTC clock label (same on server and client, no hydration mismatch). */
export function utcTime(t: number): string {
  return new Date(t * 1000).toISOString().slice(11, 16);
}
```

- [x] **Step 2: UI primitives**

Create `app/src/components/ui.tsx`:

    </div>
  );
}

export function ModeBadge({ mode }: { mode: FeeMode }) {
  const m = MODE_STYLE[mode];
  return (

### Task 19: P&L explain, safety and recent-swaps panels

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `85cb8dc`.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 15

The P&L panel also checks the fairness condition of spec §3.7: if V's realized time-average fee differs from S's fee by more than 10%, it says "Not at equal fee: the lab's comparison is the reference". The safety panel shows the two demo proofs (forged report rejected, blind mode) with transaction hashes, and checks that the protocol fee is 0 (spec §4 step 6). The recent-swaps table is what plan 06's demo video points at (fee paid per swap, arbitrage or retail).

### Task 20: Dashboard page on mock data

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `43eabbe`. The dashboard page is now `src/app/(app)/app/page.tsx` at `/app` (with `ContractsPanel` below it since 2026-10-07); `/` is the landing `src/app/(site)/page.tsx`. Step 4's mock-data look was checked in clim-front; production reads Sepolia since Task 25, and mock data is only the fallback of a build without contracts. The Step 5 line is in `docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md` ("Frontend build log").

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 16, 17, 18, 19

**Files:**
- Create: `app/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- Modify: `app/src/app/page.tsx` (replace the Task 1 stub)

- [x] **Step 1: Dashboard**

Create `app/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";
import { useClimData } from "@/hooks/useClimData";
import { deployments, EXPLORER } from "@/lib/config";
import type { Pair } from "@/lib/deployments";

export function Dashboard({ band, initialPair = "live" }: { band: LabPTradeBand; initialPair?: Pair }) {
  const pairs: Pair[] = deployments.pairs.replay ? ["live", "replay"] : ["live"];
  const [pair, setPair] = useState<Pair>(initialPair);
  const data = useClimData(pair);

  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div className="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-3">
        {pairs.length > 1
          ? pairs.map((p) => (

              </button>
            ))
          : null}
        {data.source === "mock" ? (
          <span className="rounded bg-amber-100 px-2 py-1 text-xs text-amber-900">
            Mock data: contracts not deployed yet (or NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIM_SOURCE=mock). Same decoders and formulas as live.

        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [x] **Step 2: Home page**

Create (overwrite) `app/src/app/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Dashboard } from "@/components/Dashboard";
import { params } from "@/lib/config";
import { labBand } from "@/lib/labData";
import { pipsToBp } from "@/lib/units";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div>
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Storm insurance for Uniswap v4 LPs</h1>
        <p className="text-sm text-neutral-600">
          The LP fee follows the market&apos;s weather: {pipsToBp(params.feeMinPips)} bp when calm, a toll that rises with volatility in a storm.
          Volatility comes from a Chainlink CRE risk desk; the fee is applied by a Uniswap v4 hook on every swap.
        </p>
      </div>
      <Dashboard band={labBand} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [x] **Step 3: Build**

Run: `(cd app && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build)`
Expected: the route table lists `○ /` and `○ /_not-found` as `(Static)`; no error.

- [x] **Step 4: Look at it**

Run `(cd app && npx next start -p 3000)` in the background, open http://localhost:3000, then stop the server (`lsof -ti tcp:3000 | xargs kill`). Expected on mock data:
- an amber badge "Mock data: contracts not deployed yet …";
- Desk: σ around 30 to 45%, 4 / 4 sources, age under 2 min, mode "● Normal", five `(mock)` transaction hashes;
- Quote: the curve flat at 5 bp up to about 27% (fixture P\* = 20%) then rising, a dot at the current σ, the dashed S line at 10.5 bp;
- Weather (6 h): σ calm, a storm to about 200% in the middle; the fee staircase at 5 bp rising to about 35 bp in the storm, a 30 bp degraded step around one third of the window, a red-shaded 30 bp blind step near the end; blue dots on the staircase;
- Validation: V and S around 20% observed and predicted; the observed line mostly inside the light-blue band;
- P&L explain table with "Equal within 10%: a fair comparison", the volatility quad (four percentages), Safety: 1 rejected report, 1 blind episode, protocol fee 0; Recent swaps: 12 rows, V and S, arbitrage and retail, fee paid in bp.

If a panel is missing or a chart is empty, open the browser console, fix, and re-run Steps 3 and 4.

- [x] **Step 5: Log and commit**

Append under `## Decisions` in today's session log:

```markdown
- **Dashboard on mock data (plan 05):** all panels run on a deterministic mock chain whose logs are ABI-encoded like the real ones, so switching to Sepolia changes only the data source (automatic once the live desk, hook and pools are in shared/deployments/sepolia.json; `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIM_SOURCE=mock` forces mock data).
```

```bash
git add app/src/components/Dashboard.tsx app/src/app/page.tsx docs/sessions
git commit -m "feat(app): dashboard page with desk, quote, weather, validation, P&L, vol quad, safety and swaps"
```

### Task 21: Replay and lab pages

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `621a38a`. The pages are `src/app/(app)/replay/page.tsx` and `src/app/(app)/lab/page.tsx`; Task 28 replaced the typed 74 % to 225 % range with the lab's and rounded the numbers, and the "Synthetic fixture" notes no longer show since the real lab outputs are synced.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 14, 15, 20

`/replay` is the demo's highlight (spec §8, Act 2; Task 28 later rounds the lab numbers, replaces the typed volatility range with the lab's and adds the replay-window context): the lab's replay of the 4 February 2026 storm, and below it the on-chain replay pair through the same dashboard once plan 01 records it. `/lab` shows both comparisons (spec §2.7) and the replay-window range next to the highlighted window (audit: avoid the cherry-picking suspicion), plus the honest numbers (LP gain, severity ratio, in-pool volatility share).

**Files:**
- Create: `app/src/components/ReplayCharts.tsx`, `app/src/components/ReplayPanel.tsx`, `app/src/components/BacktestTable.tsx`, `app/src/app/replay/page.tsx`, `app/src/app/lab/page.tsx`

const tick = { fontSize: 11, fill: COLORS.muted };

function Row({ title, children }: { title: string; children: ReactElement }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="text-xs font-medium text-neutral-600">{title}</div>
      <div className="h-40 w-full">
        <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height="100%">{children}</ResponsiveContainer>
      </div>
    </div>

}

export function ReplayCharts({ replay }: { replay: LabReplay }) {
  const data = replayRows(replay);
  const x = <XAxis dataKey="t" type="number" domain={["dataMin", "dataMax"]} tickFormatter={utcTime} tick={tick} />;
  const tip = <Tooltip labelFormatter={(t) => `${utcTime(Number(t))} UTC`} formatter={(v) => Number(v).toFixed(2)} />;

```

- [x] **Step 2: Replay panel**

Create `app/src/components/ReplayPanel.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { LabReplay, LabSummary } from "@/lib/lab";
import { ReplayCharts } from "./ReplayCharts";
import { FixtureNote, Panel, Stat } from "./ui";

const sgn = (x: number) => `${x >= 0 ? "+" : ""}${x.toFixed(1)}%`;

/** The lab's Feb 4 2026 replay: the storm, V's fee leaving S's, and the cumulative arbitrage losses. */
export function ReplayPanel({ replay, summary }: { replay: LabReplay; summary: LabSummary }) {
  const r = summary.replay;
  return (
    <Panel title={`Replay: ${r.window}`} subtitle={`${replay.window.startUtc} to ${replay.window.endUtc}, P* = ${(summary.setting.pStar * 100).toFixed(0)}%, S static at ${r.feeSBp.toFixed(1)} bp (V's time-average).`}>
      <FixtureNote show={replay.fixture || summary.fixture}>Synthetic fixture: the lab has not written lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json and lab/out/summary.json yet.</FixtureNote>

    </Panel>
  );
}
```

- [x] **Step 3: Backtest table**

Create `app/src/components/BacktestTable.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { LabSummary } from "@/lib/lab";

const sgn = (x: number) => `${x >= 0 ? "+" : ""}${x.toFixed(1)}%`;

export function BacktestTable({ summary }: { summary: LabSummary }) {
  const periods = [...new Set([...summary.comparisons.equalAvgFee, ...summary.comparisons.equalTraderCost, ...summary.pTrade].map((x) => x.period))];
  const find = <T extends { period: string }>(xs: T[], p: string) => xs.find((x) => x.period === p);
  return (
    <div className="overflow-x-auto">
      <table className="text-sm tabular-nums">
        <thead>
          <tr className="text-left text-xs text-neutral-500">
            <th className="pr-6">Period</th>

            return (
              <tr key={p}>
                <td className="pr-6">{p}</td>
                <td className="pr-6 font-semibold">{a ? sgn(a.arbChangePct) : "n/a"}</td>
                <td className="pr-6 font-semibold">{c ? sgn(c.arbChangePct) : "n/a"}</td>
                <td className="pr-6">{t ? `${t.predicted.toFixed(3)} / ${t.observed.toFixed(3)}` : "n/a"}</td>
                <td>{t ? t.blocks.toLocaleString("en-US") : "n/a"}</td>
              </tr>
            );
          })}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [x] **Step 4: Pages**

Create `app/src/app/replay/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Dashboard } from "@/components/Dashboard";
import { ReplayPanel } from "@/components/ReplayPanel";
import { deployments } from "@/lib/config";
import { labBand, labReplay, labSummary } from "@/lib/labData";

export default function ReplayPage() {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">The 4 February 2026 storm, replayed</h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-neutral-600">

      </p>
      <ReplayPanel replay={labReplay} summary={labSummary} />
      {deployments.pairs.replay ? <Dashboard band={labBand} initialPair="replay" /> : null}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Create `app/src/app/lab/page.tsx`:

      >
        <FixtureNote show={s.fixture}>Synthetic fixture: the lab has not written lab/out/summary.json yet.</FixtureNote>

      </Panel>
      <ReplayPanel replay={labReplay} summary={s} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [x] **Step 5: Build and look**

Run: `(cd app && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build)`
Expected: `○ /lab` and `○ /replay` in the route table. Then `(cd app && npx next start -p 3000)`, open http://localhost:3000/replay and http://localhost:3000/lab: the replay panel with four stacked charts (ETH/USD, σ rising from 74% to about 225%, V's fee leaving S's dashed line, cumulative ARB with V ending below S) and the yellow "Synthetic fixture" notes; on `/lab`, the table with both comparisons and the three honest-number bullets. Stop the server.

- [x] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add app/src/components/ReplayCharts.tsx app/src/components/ReplayPanel.tsx app/src/components/BacktestTable.tsx app/src/app/replay/page.tsx app/src/app/lab/page.tsx
git commit -m "feat(app): replay and lab pages with both backtest comparisons"
```

### Task 22: How-it-works page and FAQ

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `8d5c392`. The page is `src/app/(app)/how/page.tsx` (with `ContractsPanel` at `/how#contracts` since 2026-10-07). `docs/faq.md`'s heading is now "Can a pool that is already live switch to clim?", so Step 2 greps `already live` (2 matches on production, 2026-10-07).

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 14, 15

The plain-language explanation uses the live parameters from `params.json` (formula, η, example fees and predicted P_trade at 25/50/100/150/225%). The FAQ below it is `docs/faq.md`, rendered as is (copied by `npm run sync`), so the mentor's two questions ("how is the fee computed?", "can a live pool change its fee?") are answered from one source shared with the README and deck.

**Files:**
- Create: `app/src/app/how/page.tsx`

- [x] **Step 1: Write the page**

Create `app/src/app/how/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import ReactMarkdown from "react-markdown";
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";
import { Panel } from "@/components/ui";
import { FAQ_MD } from "@/generated/faq";
import { params } from "@/lib/config";

import { predictedPTrade } from "@/lib/ptrade";
import { annualPctToSigmaE9, pipsToBp } from "@/lib/units";

const EXAMPLES = [25, 50, 100, 150, 225];

export default function HowPage() {
  const rows = EXAMPLES.map((s) => {
    const sigma = annualPctToSigmaE9(s);
    const fee = feePips(sigma, params.etaE4, params.sqrtHalfDtE6, 10_000, params.feeMinPips, params.feeMaxPips);
    return { s, fee, p: predictedPTrade(fee, sigma, params.sqrtHalfDtE6) };
  });
  return (

      <Panel title="1. Four weather stations must agree (Chainlink CRE)">
        <p className="text-sm">
          Every 30 seconds a Chainlink CRE workflow pulls one-minute ETH candles from Coinbase, Kraken, Binance and Hyperliquid, plus
          Deribit&apos;s DVOL. A venue whose last candle is older than 120 s is dropped; with fewer than 3 venues there is no report.
          Each node computes the median price per minute and the 15-minute realised volatility (RV15); the DON takes the median of
          every field and writes one signed report to <code>RiskDesk.onReport</code>.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm">
          RiskDesk only stores the number after checks: reports at least 20 s apart, at most 30 s in the future, at least 3 sources,
          and σ may move only between 0.8× and 2× its previous value per report (volatility rises fast, falls slowly). Dispersion
          between venues above 25 bp flags the report as degraded. No function sets σ or the fee: the owner only chooses which forwarder to trust, and every report stays inside these bounds.

          Nobody sends a transaction to change the fee. On every swap the Uniswap v4 PoolManager calls the hook&apos;s
          <code> beforeSwap</code>; the hook reads <code>RiskDesk.state()</code>, computes the fee and returns it with
          <code> OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG</code>. The same fee applies in both directions and does not depend on the pool&apos;s own state,
          so splitting a trade or sandwiching it does not change it.

### Task 23: Chain snapshot script

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); clim-front commit `7d44982`. The refusal is line 16 of `scripts/snapshot.ts`; with the live pair synced, the script ran for real in Task 26.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 11, 14

**Files:**
- Create: `app/scripts/snapshot.ts`

- [x] **Step 1: Write the script**

Create `app/scripts/snapshot.ts`:

```ts
// Freezes the pair's on-chain history (RiskReported + Swap logs) into public/data/chain/<pair>.json.
// The dashboard loads it first and only asks the RPC for newer blocks, so the live URL keeps working
// after the hackathon even on RPCs with pruned log history. Run: npm run snapshot -- live
import { mkdirSync, writeFileSync } from "node:fs";
import { type ChainSnapshot, fetchPairLogs, fillTimestamps, makeClient } from "@/lib/chain";
import { deployments } from "@/lib/config";
import { decodeDeliveries, decodeReports, decodeSwaps } from "@/lib/decode";
import { type Pair, PAIRS, SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID } from "@/lib/deployments";

const CONFIRMATIONS = 3;

async function main() {
  const pair = (process.argv[2] ?? "live") as Pair;
  if (!PAIRS.includes(pair)) throw new Error(`unknown pair ${pair}, use one of ${PAIRS.join(", ")}`);
  const d = deployments.pairs[pair];
  if (!d) throw new Error(`pair ${pair} is not in src/generated/sepolia.json: run npm run sync after deploying`);
  const client = makeClient();
  const head = await client.getBlock({ blockTag: "latest" });
  const to = Number(head.number) - CONFIRMATIONS;
  const anchor = { block: Number(head.number), t: Number(head.timestamp) };
  const logs = await fetchPairLogs(client, d, deployments, d.startBlock, to);
  const snap: ChainSnapshot = {
    schema: "clim.chainSnapshot/1",
    pair,
    chainId: SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID,
    fromBlock: d.startBlock,
    toBlock: to,
    generatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    deskLogs: fillTimestamps(logs.deskLogs, anchor),
    swapLogs: fillTimestamps(logs.swapLogs, anchor),
    forwarderLogs: fillTimestamps(logs.forwarderLogs, anchor),
  };
  mkdirSync("public/data/chain", { recursive: true });
  writeFileSync(`public/data/chain/${pair}.json`, JSON.stringify(snap));
  console.log(
    `public/data/chain/${pair}.json: blocks ${snap.fromBlock}..${snap.toBlock}, ${decodeReports(snap.deskLogs).length} reports, ${decodeSwaps(snap.swapLogs).length} swaps, ${decodeDeliveries(snap.forwarderLogs).filter((x) => !x.accepted).length} rejected deliveries`,
  );
}

main().catch((e) => {
  console.error(e instanceof Error ? e.message : e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

- [x] **Step 2: Run it before deployment, expected clean refusal**

Run: `(cd app && npm run snapshot -- live)`
Expected (while the live pair is not deployed): `pair live is not in src/generated/sepolia.json: run npm run sync after deploying`, exit code 1. (Validated in the scratch project against real Sepolia logs: with a temporary plan-04-shaped deployments file pointing at an existing pool and an existing forwarder receiver, it wrote `public/data/chain/live.json` covering 3,000 blocks with 35 swaps and 3 rejected deliveries.)

- [x] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add app/scripts/snapshot.ts
git commit -m "feat(app): freeze on-chain log history into a static snapshot"
```

### Task 24: First deployment to Vercel (mock data)

Done in DVB-ANS/clim-front, imported into app/ by master Task 14 (subtree 758ab5a); the URL was logged in clim-front commit `5f51267`. Deployed with the CLI from the clim-front root; since master Task 14 production deploys from the clim repo root (Vercel Root Directory `app`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`/`VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, Task 25 Step 5), not with `vercel link` in `app/`. Checked on 2026-10-07 with curl: `/`, `/app`, `/replay`, `/lab`, `/how`, `/swap`, `/lp`, `/credits` and `/data/lab/replay-2026-02-04.json` answer 200, and `/how` contains "already live".

**Delegable:** no (uses the maintainer's Vercel account)
**Depends on:** Tasks 20, 21, 22

Done in clim-front: https://clim-zeta.vercel.app (Vercel project `clim`, logged in clim-front's session log). After the import, production deploys from the clim repo root to the same project (Root Directory `app`, Task 25 Step 5), so the URL does not change.

Deploying early gives the submission a live URL from the start; later deployments only refresh data.

- [x] **Step 1: Check the CLI session**

Run: `(cd app && vercel whoami)`
Expected: the maintainer's Vercel username. If it asks to log in, the maintainer runs `vercel login` himself.

- [x] **Step 2: Link and deploy from app/**

```bash
(cd app && vercel link --yes --project clim)
(cd app && vercel deploy --prod --yes)
```
Expected: `vercel link` creates `app/.vercel/` (already ignored by `app/.gitignore`); `vercel deploy` builds remotely (`next build`, same route table as locally) and prints the production URL. The stable address is the production domain of project `clim` (Vercel dashboard → clim → Domains), for example `https://clim-<suffix>.vercel.app`.

- [x] **Step 3: Verify it is public and complete**

```bash
URL=https://<the production domain from Step 2>
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" $URL/ && curl -s $URL/how | grep -c "already live" && curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" $URL/data/lab/replay-2026-02-04.json
```
Expected: `200`, a count of at least `1`, `200`. If the page asks for a Vercel login, turn off Vercel Authentication for production in Project Settings → Deployment Protection (judges must reach it without an account).

- [x] **Step 4: Log the URL and commit**

Append under `## Decisions` in today's session log, with the domain from Step 2:

```markdown
- **Live URL (plan 05):** https://<production domain> (Vercel project `clim`, deployed from app/). Mock data until the contracts are deployed; redeploy with `(cd app && vercel deploy --prod --yes)` after every `npm run sync`.
```

```bash
git add docs/sessions
git commit -m "docs(session): record the dashboard's live URL"
```

---

### Task 25: Wire to Sepolia (and re-sync whenever shared/ or lab/out change)

**Delegable:** no (needs the deployed addresses and the running bots)
**Depends on:** plan 01 (`shared/deployments/sepolia.json` with the live desk, hook, pools, `deployBlock` and `routers.arb`; `shared/abis/`), plan 03 (`shared/params.json`, `lab/out/*.json`), plans 02 and 04 (reports and swaps flowing); Task 24

Repeat Steps 1 to 6 every time `shared/` or `lab/out/` changes (P\* decision, new deployment, new lab results).

**Done in clim on 2026-10-07** at clim-front `d05ee94` (imported into `app/`). What differs from the text below: the dashboard is at `/app` (the landing is `/`); `/swap` and `/lp` show only the on-chain mode once the deployment has the live pair (no simulated switch or label in production); the replay pair reads as a finished run (`src/lib/finished.ts`: badge "Finished replay on Sepolia", its span and why its hook now quotes the 30 bp safe fee, history panels ending at its last swap); a Contracts panel on `/app` and `/how#contracts` lists every address with Etherscan and Sourcify links; production deploys from the repo root (Vercel Root Directory `app/`, root `.vercelignore`). Results are in the session log of 2026-10-07 (Build notes).

- [x] **Step 1: Gate check**

```bash
jq '{deployBlock, desk: .riskDesks.live, hook: .hooks.live, V: .pools.liveV.poolId, S: .pools.liveS.poolId, arb: .routers.arb}' shared/deployments/sepolia.json && jq -r .decidedBy shared/params.json && ls lab/out/
```
Expected: no `null` among `deployBlock`, `desk`, `hook`, `V`, `S`, `arb`; `decidedBy` does not start with `PROVISIONAL`. Missing lab files are fine (fixtures stay, flagged on the page).

- [x] **Step 2: Sync**

Run: `(cd app && npm run sync)`
Expected: `src/generated/sepolia.json` and `src/generated/params.json` show `repo`; each lab file shows `repo` once plan 03 wrote it.

- [x] **Step 3: Tests, including the ABI drift guard**

Run: `(cd app && npm test && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build)`
Expected: no `failed` test, and no skipped one once `shared/abis/RiskDesk.json` and `shared/abis/ClimHook.json` exist (the 2 drift tests now run). Observed: `Tests  156 passed (156)` right after the first sync at clim-front `d05ee94`, then `Test Files  21 passed (21)`, `Tests  170 passed (170)` with Task 28 and the post-import changes. A `deployments: poolId mismatch for liveV` error at build means `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` is wrong: fix it in plan 01's script, not in the app. A schema error from a lab file means plan 03 and Task 7 disagree: reconcile `app/src/lib/lab.ts` (interface 6) and log it.

- [x] **Step 4: Cross-check the dashboard against the chain**

```bash
HOOK=$(jq -r .hooks.live shared/deployments/sepolia.json); DESK=$(jq -r .riskDesks.live shared/deployments/sepolia.json)
cast call $HOOK "quoteFee()(uint24,uint8)" --rpc-url https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co
cast call $DESK "state()(uint40,uint32,uint16,uint8,uint32)" --rpc-url https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co
```
Then run `(cd app && npx next start -p 3000)`, open http://localhost:3000/app and check:
- the badge reads "Live from Sepolia: RiskDesk 0x…, hook 0x…" with Etherscan links (on the replay pair: "Finished replay on Sepolia");
- the Quote panel's V fee in bp equals the first `quoteFee` value divided by 100, with the same mode (0 normal, 1 degraded, 2 blind);
- the Desk panel's σ applied equals `state().sigmaE9` converted (`sigmaE9 / 1e9 × √31,536,000 × 100` %), and its last `#seq` equals `state().seq`;
- in the weather chart, every blue dot (a real `Swap.fee`) sits on the staircase rebuilt from `RiskReported` logs;
- Validation shows V and S counts; Safety shows protocol fee 0.

Stop the server. Any mismatch is a bug in the app or in a contract: debug with superpowers:systematic-debugging before going on.

Done on 2026-10-07 without a person at the browser: a headless Chromium (Playwright) rendered `/app`, `/swap` and `/replay` against `next start` and against production, the visible numbers (read from the counters' screen-reader copy) were compared with `cast` reads taken a few seconds later (seq, σ, mode, V and S fees, V's price, the replay desk's seq 459 and its blind 30 bp), and every `Swap.fee` on V was checked against the staircase rebuilt from `RiskReported` logs on the frozen snapshots with the app's own `quoteFee` (519 of 519 live, 520 of 520 replay). The table is in the session log.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit and redeploy**

```bash
P=(app/src/generated app/public/data/lab)
git add $P && git commit -m "chore(app): sync Sepolia deployments, params and lab outputs" -- $P
VERCEL_ORG_ID=team_bCob7HCJS9NchRXoSxF72ygr VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_9VyLbkFAAOnESPzvfjKL8MMjVMsm vercel deploy --prod --yes
```
Run the deploy from the repo root: the Vercel project's Root Directory is `app/` and the root `.vercelignore` uploads `app/` only (the build reads nothing outside `app/` after `npm run sync`). Expected: a `Production: https://clim-<hash>-gamween-7559s-projects.vercel.app` line, the alias https://clim-zeta.vercel.app on the new deployment, and `/app` showing "Live from Sepolia".

- [x] **Step 6: Log**

Append under `## Build notes` in today's session log, with the real addresses:

```markdown
- (app) Dashboard wired to Sepolia: RiskDesk <address from shared/deployments>, ClimHook <address>; `quoteFee()` on-chain matches the Quote panel and every `Swap.fee` dot sits on the staircase rebuilt from `RiskReported` logs (plan 05 Task 25).
```

```bash
git add docs/sessions/<today>.md && git commit -m "docs(session): dashboard wired to Sepolia" -- docs/sessions/<today>.md
```

---

### Task 26: Freeze the on-chain history before submission

**Delegable:** no
**Depends on:** Task 25; run after the last demo data (the plan 00 / 06 "on-chain freeze" gate), before the submission deadline

Judges open the URL later; this makes the page load the full history from a static file and ask the RPC only for newer blocks.

- [x] **Step 1: Snapshot**

```bash
(cd app && npm run snapshot -- live)
(cd app && jq -e '.riskDesks.replay' src/generated/sepolia.json >/dev/null && npm run snapshot -- replay || echo "no replay pair")
```
Expected: `public/data/chain/live.json: blocks <startBlock>..<head-3>, <N> reports, <M> swaps, <K> rejected deliveries` with N, M > 0 and K ≥ 1 after the forged-report demo. Observed on 2026-10-07: `live.json: blocks 11856974..11858653, 622 reports, 1033 swaps, 2 rejected deliveries` and `replay.json: blocks 11856974..11858654, 459 reports, 1028 swaps, 0 rejected deliveries` (the replay is finished, so its file is final).

- [x] **Step 2: Build, check, commit, deploy**

```bash
(cd app && npm run build)
git add app/public/data/chain && git commit -m "chore(app): freeze on-chain log history for the submission" -- app/public/data/chain
VERCEL_ORG_ID=team_bCob7HCJS9NchRXoSxF72ygr VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_9VyLbkFAAOnESPzvfjKL8MMjVMsm vercel deploy --prod --yes   # from the repo root (Task 25 Step 5)
```
Then open the production URL: the badge ends with "history from the frozen snapshot", and the charts load in a few seconds.

- [x] **Step 3: Log**

Append under `## Build notes` in today's session log:

```markdown
- (app) On-chain history frozen: app/public/data/chain/live.json covers blocks <from>..<to> (<N> reports, <M> swaps); the live URL reads it first and polls only newer blocks (plan 05 Task 26).
```

```bash
git add docs/sessions/<today>.md && git commit -m "docs(session): on-chain history frozen in the dashboard" -- docs/sessions/<today>.md
```

---

### Task 27: Test-swap page (superseded by `/swap` and `/lp`)

**Delegable:** yes (the browser check needs a wallet with Sepolia ETH)
**Depends on:** Task 25, plan 01 Task 7 (`TestToken.faucet()`)

The Frontend scope upgrade (session log 2026-10-06) made `/swap` and `/lp` core pages, and clim-front built them (its session log, "`/swap`" and "`/lp` through `PoolModifyLiquidityTest`"). They replace this task's former optional page, which minted with the owner-only `mint` and could not work for visitors. Files (in `app/`): `src/app/swap/page.tsx`, `src/app/lp/page.tsx`, `src/components/{SwapForm,LiquidityBoard,LiquidityForm,PositionPanel,FaucetCard,TxSteps,TxModeSwitch,WalletButton,WalletProviders}.tsx`, `src/hooks/{useTxFlow,useChainSteps,useLpState,useStored}.ts`, `src/lib/{wallet,swap,liquidity,tx}.ts` with their tests. Until the live pair is in `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` both pages run a simulated mode (same steps, fake hashes); with the live pair the on-chain mode is the only one shown (since 2026-10-07, no switch). In clim the pages live under `app/src/app/(app)/` and the transaction code also uses `src/lib/{swap,liquidity,tx}.ts`'s `swapArgs`, `fullRangeParams`, `approvalWithMargin` and `withGasMargin`.

**Done on 2026-10-07 by script, not with a browser wallet** (the maintainer was away and no wallet may be connected in a browser): `app/scripts/e2e-onchain.ts` (`npm run e2e:onchain -- <env file with TEST_PRIVATE_KEY> [--out summary.json]`) sends what the UI sends, with the UI's own builders, from a throwaway test key; the browser check of the pages is read-only (they load, show the live numbers and the Connect button). The faucet credits 10 tETH and 25,000 tUSD per hour (`faucetAmount()`, `FAUCET_COOLDOWN()` = 3600).

- [x] **Step 1: Check the pages in a browser, on Sepolia**

After Task 25 (live pair synced and deployed), with MetaMask or Rabby on Sepolia and some Sepolia ETH for gas: open `/lp`, Connect, "Get tETH and tUSD" (two `faucet()` transactions), add 1 tETH of full-range liquidity to pool V; then open `/swap` and swap 0.1 tETH on V, then on S. By script instead: `(cd app && npm run e2e:onchain -- <key file> --out <summary.json>)`; expected `PASS` on every check (V's `Swap.fee` equals `ClimHook.quoteFee()` in the swap's block or the one before, S's equals its PoolKey fee, each position read back from StateView then removed, `FaucetCooldown` decoded on a second run within the hour) and every receipt `success`.
Expected:
- the faucet credits 10 tETH and 25,000 tUSD; a second click within the hour fails with `FaucetCooldown` (decoded thanks to Task 28's ABI fragment);
- `/lp` shows the position (liquidity, value, uncollected fees) and "if you had been in S";
- each swap's status line ends with the fee paid and an Etherscan link; on V it equals the Quote panel's fee at that time, on S the static fee; the dashboard counts these swaps as retail (they go through `uniswap.poolSwapTest`, not `routers.arb`).

- [x] **Step 2: Log**

Append under `## Build notes` in today's session log:
```markdown
- (app) `/swap` and `/lp` checked on Sepolia (by script or with a wallet): faucet <tx>, liquidity added to V <tx>, swap on V paid <x> bp (Quote panel <x> bp), swap on S paid <s> bp (plan 05 Task 27).
```
```bash
git add docs/sessions/<today>.md && git commit -m "docs(session): /swap and /lp checked on Sepolia" -- docs/sessions/<today>.md
```

### Task 28: Post-import fixes from the plan review (in clim, after master plan Task 14 imports clim-front)

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** master plan Task 14 Steps 1 to 4 (the app is in `app/`, `npm ci` done); plan 01 Task 7 (the `TestToken` faucet); plan 03 Task 17 (the `replay.windows*` fields of `lab/out/summary.json`; until they exist the replay note is simply not shown)

The plan review (2026-10-06) found what the clim-front build could not know: lab numbers printed with 8 significant digits, a typed volatility range on `/replay` that contradicts the lab, no context for the replay window (at P\* = 0.3 no rolling 4 h window of the storm does better: best −18.4 %, median −2.1 %), and no ABI fragment for the faucet's cooldown error. The fixes below were applied to a scratch import of clim-front at commit `c924078` and checked there (`tsc`, `eslint`, `vitest`, `next build`).

**Files:**
- Create: `app/src/lib/labText.ts`, `app/src/lib/labText.test.ts`
- Modify: `app/src/lib/lab.ts`, `app/src/app/(app)/lab/page.tsx`, `app/src/app/(app)/replay/page.tsx`, `app/src/components/ReplayPanel.tsx`, `app/src/lib/abis.ts`, `app/src/lib/abis.test.ts`

**Done in clim on 2026-10-07** (commit `fix(app): round lab numbers, replay range from data, replay-window context, faucet error ABI`). The imported app is clim-front `d05ee94`, not `c924078`: the pages live under the route group `src/app/(app)/`, and the code below is what was committed. The replay note now uses the README's wording ("no rolling 4 h window of the storm does better (best −18.4 %); median −2.1 %; 66 of 92 windows beat the fixed pool"); the lab page's LP-gain line follows the README too (+0.40 % is the main scenario on an asset twice as volatile, not an upper bound); a drift test checks the TestToken fragments against `shared/abis/TestToken.json`.

- [x] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`app/src/lib/labText.test.ts`:
```ts
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import { replayWindowNote, roundPct, signedPct, usdPerMillion } from "./labText";

describe("lab numbers as judges read them", () => {
  it("rounds the lab's 8 significant digits", () => {
    expect(signedPct(0.70240233)).toBe("+0.70%");
    expect(signedPct(-0.0981486)).toBe("-0.10%");
    expect(signedPct(-2.1181905, 1)).toBe("-2.1%");
    expect(roundPct(52.87945)).toBe("53%");
    expect(roundPct(103.34705)).toBe("103%");
  });

  it("turns % of capital per year into dollars per $1M of liquidity", () => {
    expect(usdPerMillion(0.39)).toBe("$3,900");
    expect(usdPerMillion(-0.0981486)).toBe("-$981");
    expect(usdPerMillion(0.70240233)).toBe("$7,024");
  });

  it("puts the replay window in the context of the rolling windows, in the README's words", () => {
    const r = { arbChangeRangePct: [-18.366445, 3.1499447] as [number, number], windowsMedianPct: -2.1181905, windowsBetterCount: 66, windowsCount: 92, windowsBeatingChosenCount: 0 };
    expect(replayWindowNote(r)).toBe(
      "Picked during design at an earlier setting, around the sharpest rise in volatility: at this P* no rolling 4 h window of the storm does better (best -18.4%); median -2.1%; 66 of 92 windows beat the fixed pool.",
    );
    expect(replayWindowNote(r)).not.toMatch(/most favou?rable/);
    expect(replayWindowNote({ ...r, windowsBeatingChosenCount: 3 })).toContain("3 of the 92 rolling 4 h windows of the storm did better");
    expect(replayWindowNote({})).toBeNull();
  });
});
```

- [x] **Step 2: Run it, expected FAIL**

Run: `(cd app && npx vitest run src/lib/labText.test.ts)`
Expected: `Error: Cannot find module './labText'` and `Tests  no tests`.

- [x] **Step 3: Minimal implementation**

`app/src/lib/labText.ts`:
```ts
// Display helpers for lab numbers: lab/out/*.json carries 8 significant digits, judges see rounded values
// (shares to whole percent, % of capital per year to 2 decimals), the same rule as the README and the deck (plan 06).

/** Signed percent with a fixed number of decimals: "+0.70%", "-0.10%". */
export function signedPct(x: number, digits = 2): string {
  return `${x > 0 ? "+" : ""}${x.toFixed(digits)}%`;
}

/** A share in whole percent: "53%". */
export function roundPct(x: number): string {
  return `${Math.round(x)}%`;
}

/** A gain in % of capital per year as dollars per year per $1M of liquidity (1% of $1M = $10,000). */
export function usdPerMillion(pctPerYear: number): string {
  const usd = Math.round(Math.abs(pctPerYear) * 10_000);
  return `${pctPerYear < 0 ? "-" : ""}$${usd.toLocaleString("en-US")}`;
}

export type ReplayWindows = {
  arbChangeRangePct?: [number, number];
  windowsMedianPct?: number;
  windowsBetterCount?: number;
  windowsCount?: number;
  windowsBeatingChosenCount?: number;
};

/** The replay window against the rolling 4 h windows of the storm (plan 03 Task 17); null with an older summary.json. */
export function replayWindowNote(r: ReplayWindows): string | null {
  const { windowsMedianPct: median, windowsBetterCount: better, windowsCount: n, windowsBeatingChosenCount: beating } = r;
  if (median === undefined || better === undefined || n === undefined || beating === undefined) return null;
  const best = r.arbChangeRangePct?.[0];
  // The replay window (12:00-16:00) is not one of the rolling windows (they start at :16), so the note says
  // that none does better, in the README's words, rather than calling it the best of them.
  const where = beating === 0
    ? `no rolling 4 h window of the storm does better${best === undefined ? "" : ` (best ${signedPct(best, 1)})`}`
    : `${beating} of the ${n} rolling 4 h windows of the storm did better`;
  return `Picked during design at an earlier setting, around the sharpest rise in volatility: at this P* ${where}; median ${signedPct(median, 1)}; ${better} of ${n} windows beat the fixed pool.`;
}
```

- [x] **Step 4: Run, expected PASS**

Run: `(cd app && npx vitest run src/lib/labText.test.ts)`
Expected: `Tests  3 passed (3)`.

- [x] **Step 5: Use the helpers and the new fields**

Make these exact replacements (each old text occurs once).

In `app/src/lib/lab.ts`, replace
```ts
    arbChangeRangePct: [number, number];
    pTradePredicted: number;
```
with
```ts
    arbChangeRangePct: [number, number];
    // Added by plan 03 Task 17 in the fixer pass; absent from older outputs and from the fixtures.
    windowsMedianPct?: number;
    windowsBetterCount?: number;
    windowsCount?: number;
    windowsBeatingChosenCount?: number;
    pTradePredicted: number;
```

In `app/src/app/(app)/lab/page.tsx`, replace
```tsx
import { labReplay, labSummary } from "@/lib/labData";
```
with
```tsx
import { labReplay, labSummary } from "@/lib/labData";
import { roundPct, signedPct, usdPerMillion } from "@/lib/labText";
```
and replace the three `<li>` lines
```tsx
          <li>LP gain, full-range ETH: {lo}% to {hi}% of capital per year (up to {s.lpGain.volatileAssetPctPerYearMax}% on volatile assets); {s.lpGain.shareFromTop5WeeksPct}% of it in the five most turbulent weeks.</li>
          <li>The model predicts how often arbitrage happens; it underestimates how much it takes: observed ARB/LVR is {s.modelSeverityRatio[0]} to {s.modelSeverityRatio[1]} times the model.</li>
          <li>A volatility computed inside the pool gets {s.inPoolVolGainSharePct[0]}% to {s.inPoolVolGainSharePct[1]}% of the same gain: Chainlink CRE is here for robustness (four venues must agree), not accuracy.</li>
```
with
```tsx
          <li>
            LP gain, full-range ETH: {signedPct(lo)} to {signedPct(hi)} of capital per year ({usdPerMillion(lo)} to {usdPerMillion(hi)} a year per $1M of liquidity).
            In the main scenario, about {roundPct(s.lpGain.shareFromTop5WeeksPct)} of the gain is earned in the five most turbulent weeks; the same scenario on an
            asset twice as volatile (the same year with every return doubled) gains {signedPct(s.lpGain.volatileAssetPctPerYearMax)} a year.
          </li>
          <li>The model predicts how often arbitrage happens; it underestimates how much it takes: observed ARB/LVR is {s.modelSeverityRatio[0].toFixed(2)} to {s.modelSeverityRatio[1].toFixed(2)} times the model.</li>
          <li>A volatility computed inside the pool gets {roundPct(s.inPoolVolGainSharePct[0])} to {roundPct(s.inPoolVolGainSharePct[1])} of the same gain{s.inPoolVolGainSharePct[1] > 100 ? " (above 100%: it did slightly better in one sample)" : ""}: Chainlink CRE is here for robustness (four venues must agree), not accuracy.</li>
```

In `app/src/app/(app)/replay/page.tsx`, replace
```tsx
        Binance ETHUSDT, 12:00 to 16:00 UTC: hourly volatility goes from 74% to 225%. Below, the lab&apos;s replay of that window
```
with
```tsx
        Binance ETHUSDT, 12:00 to 16:00 UTC: the desk&apos;s 15-minute volatility ranges from {Math.round(labSummary.replay.sigmaMinPct)}% to{" "}
        {Math.round(labSummary.replay.sigmaMaxPct)}% a year. Below, the lab&apos;s replay of that window
```

In `app/src/components/ReplayPanel.tsx`, replace
```tsx
import type { LabReplay, LabSummary } from "@/lib/lab";
```
with
```tsx
import type { LabReplay, LabSummary } from "@/lib/lab";
import { replayWindowNote } from "@/lib/labText";
```
and replace
```tsx
      <ReplayCharts replay={replay} />
```
with
```tsx
      {replayWindowNote(r) ? <p className="mb-3 text-xs text-fg-muted">{replayWindowNote(r)}</p> : null}
      <ReplayCharts replay={replay} />
```

In `app/src/lib/abis.ts`, replace
```ts
  // Frontend scope upgrade: public faucet with a fixed amount and a per-address cooldown (plan 01 change).
  "function faucet()",
]);
```
with
```ts
  // Frontend scope upgrade: public faucet with a fixed amount and a per-address cooldown (plan 01 Task 7:
  // 10 tETH or 25,000 tUSD per address per hour). The error lets viem decode a second click within the hour.
  "function faucet()",
  "function faucetAmount() view returns (uint256)",
  "function lastFaucetAt(address account) view returns (uint256)",
  "error FaucetCooldown(uint256 nextAt)",
]);
```

- [x] **Step 6: Run everything**

Run: `(cd app && npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build)`
Expected: `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint` print no error; no `failed` test and none skipped once `shared/abis/` exists. Observed on 2026-10-07 at clim-front `d05ee94` plus this task: `Test Files  19 passed (19)`, `Tests  160 passed (160)` (156 after the sync, plus labText's 3 and the TestToken drift test); the route table lists `/`, `/app`, `/credits`, `/how`, `/lab`, `/lp`, `/replay` and `/swap`, all static.

- [x] **Step 7: Commit and redeploy**

```bash
P=(app/src/lib/labText.ts app/src/lib/labText.test.ts app/src/lib/lab.ts "app/src/app/(app)/lab/page.tsx" "app/src/app/(app)/replay/page.tsx" app/src/components/ReplayPanel.tsx app/src/lib/abis.ts app/src/lib/abis.test.ts)
git add $P && git commit -m "fix(app): round lab numbers, replay range from data, replay-window context, faucet error ABI" -- $P
```
Commit with the paths (`git commit -- <paths>`): another session may have staged its own files. The redeploy comes with Task 25 Step 5 (from the repo root, see there).

## Self-review (performed when writing this plan)

**1. Spec coverage** (spec §3.10, §4, §5, §7, §8 and the orchestrator's list):

| Requirement | Task |
|---|---|
| "/" Desk panel: σ (applied vs reported), RV15, DVOL, dispersion, nSources, age τ, mode, flags, zone, last CRE tx hashes | 16 |
| Quote panel: V vs S fee in bp, theoretical curve fee(σ) with the current point | 16 |
| Weather chart: σ over time with the fee stepping under it, swap fee dots, S line, blind shading (the mentor's "how is the fee computed?") | 8, 17 |
| Validation: rolling P_trade predicted vs observed inside the simulated band; totals for V and S | 9, 18 |
| LP P&L explain per pool (LVR, FEE_arb, ARB, FEE_retail) and the "not at equal fee" label | 10, 19 |
| Volatility quad (σ_IV, σ_RV, σ_arb, σ_BE) | 9, 10, 18 |
| Safety: forged-report rejection and blind-mode evidence with tx hashes; protocol fee 0 check | 5, 8, 11, 19 |
| "/replay" and "/lab": Feb 4 replay (price, σ, fee V vs S, cumulative ARB), backtest summary with both comparisons, replay-window range, honest numbers; same lab files as plan 06 | 7, 21 |
| Recent swaps on the live page (plan 06's demo) | 10, 19 |
| "/how": plain-language explanation + FAQ incl. "can a live pool change its fee?" | 13, 22 |
| `/swap` and `/lp` with a wallet and the faucet (Frontend scope upgrade, built in clim-front) | 27 (check on Sepolia), 28 (faucet error ABI) |
| Data layer: chunked getLogs filtered by poolId, RPC fallback, lab JSON loader, deployments from shared/ | 6, 7, 11, 13, 14 |
| Mock data first, then Sepolia and lab/out | 12, 14, 20, 25 |
| Vercel deployment with exact commands; history frozen for judges | 24, 26 |
| TDD of pure transforms (decoding, series, rolling P_trade, bp formatting) | 2 to 13 |
| Session-log lines at each decision or surprise | 1, 7, 9, 11, 12, 20, 24, 25, 26 |

Gaps, consciously left out: the per-window severity test (spec §7.4) is shown only as the summary's `modelSeverityRatio` range until plan 03 publishes per-window values; the Basel zone colours wait for `zone` to be non-zero (P2).

**2. Placeholder scan.** Searched for TBD, TODO, "implement later", "similar to Task", "add error handling": none. The only angle-bracket fill-ins are runtime values the executor reads off a command output (the Vercel domain, deployed addresses, block numbers) inside session-log lines and the interface example of `shared/deployments/sepolia.json`.

**Fixer pass (2026-10-06).** Tasks 1 to 24 and the scope upgrade ran in DVB-ANS/clim-front; Task 27 became the Sepolia check of `/swap` and `/lp`; Task 28 holds the review's fixes, validated on a scratch `git subtree` import of clim-front `c924078` (126 passed and 2 skipped, typecheck, lint and `next build` with `/lp` and `/swap`).

**3. Type and name consistency.** Checked across tasks: `DeskReport`, `SwapRow`, `Delivery`, `RawLog`, `PairDeployment`, `Params`, `FeeParams`, `Quote`, `FeeMode`, `PairState` (with `protocolFees`), `ClimData` (with `deliveries`), `LabSummary`/`LabReplay`/`ReplayRow`/`LabPTradeBand`, `WeatherPoint`, `SwapView`, `BlindEpisode`, `PTradePoint`; functions `feePips`, `quoteFee`, `decodeReports`, `decodeSwaps`, `decodeDeliveries`, `lastAtOrBefore`, `parseDeployments`, `parseParams`, `computePoolId`, `weatherSeries`, `blindEpisodes`, `timeAverageFeeBp`, `predictedPTrade`, `makePredictor`, `rollingPTrade`, `pTradeTotals`, `sigmaArbAnnualPct`, `pnlExplain`, `sigmaBreakEvenAnnualPct`, `recentSwapRows`, `parseSummary`, `parseReplay`, `replayRows`, `parsePTradeBand`, `bandAt`, `fetchPairLogs(client, pair, deployments, from, to)`, `readPairState(client, pair, stateView)`, `makeMockWorld`. The code was compiled (`tsc --noEmit`), linted, unit-tested (91 passed, 2 skipped) and built (`next build`, 6 static routes) in a scratch copy, then copied into this plan verbatim by a script; a second, fresh scaffold then replayed the plan task by task from this text (every expected FAIL and PASS above, the builds after Tasks 20, 21, 22 and 27, the snapshot refusal, and the pages in a browser were observed).
