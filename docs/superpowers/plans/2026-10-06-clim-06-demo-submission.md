# clim Demo and Submission Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Turn the working clim system into a complete TOKEN2049 Origins submission: a judge-ready README with generated numbers and CRE evidence, a precise FAQ (including the Chainlink mentor's two questions), the maintainer's own demo video (on camera, then a live demo), a .pptx deck assembled from his Figma slides with the video embedded, a Google Drive link, and the main-track plus CRE-track submission, then close the loop with the Chainlink friction log and the private notes.

**Architecture:** A small Node.js package in `docs/submission/` (plain ES modules, `node:test`, no build step; the fee formula is imported from plan 04's `shared/src/units.ts`, which Node 22 loads directly) reads the single sources of truth (`shared/deployments/sepolia.json`, `shared/params.json`, `lab/out/backtest-summary.json`, `lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json`, on-chain `RiskReported` events) and generates (1) the numeric blocks of `README.md` between `<!-- clim:begin X -->` markers, (2) `docs/evidence/` (CRE evidence), and (3) the deck `docs/submission/out/clim.pptx`, assembled with pptxgenjs from the slides the maintainer designs in Figma (deck v2 since 2026-10-07, cut to 10 slides the same day: one full-bleed PNG per slide, the slide text and speaker notes from `deck/v2/slides.json`, the 30-second stage cut of the demo video he records embedded, re-encoded with ffmpeg when needed; the full video goes on Google Drive and its link is the Project link). One Python script (run with `uv run --no-project`) draws the README figure. No number in the README or the evidence is typed by hand; the numbers on the slides are typed in Figma from the same sources, which each slide's speaker notes name, and the live report count comes from `deck/v2/live.json`.

**Tech Stack:** Node.js 22 (ES modules, `node:test`), pptxgenjs 4.0.1, viem 2.57.3, Python 3 via uv (matplotlib, Pillow, pytest), Figma (the slides, 3840 x 2160 frames exported at 1x), ffmpeg/ffprobe (video checks and re-encoding), Foundry `cast` (the live report count), LibreOffice run from its disk image (slide render), Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac (installed) for the final playback check, the `anthropic-skills:pptx` skill for deck QA, Google Drive (browser), Builderbase (submission platform), `gh`.

All commands below use absolute paths because subagent shells reset their working directory. `CLIM` means `/Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim`.

## Verified hackathon rules (quoted, retrieved 2026-10-06)

Sources: Builderbase event JSON `curl https://edge.builderbase.com/super-events/public/token2049-origins-hackathon` (field `data.super_event.page_data.html`, page updated `2026-10-04T08:00:30Z`), `curl https://edge.builderbase.com/events/public/chainlink-best-workflow-with-cre` (page updated `2026-10-06T00:36:27Z`), https://www.token2049.com/singapore/2049-origins, and the Terms and Conditions PDF linked from the event JSON (`tc_file_url`). Re-run the two `curl` commands in Task 21 Step 1 in case the pages changed.

**What every team submits (main track page):**
> "GitHub repository : public, or with judge access granted."
> "Project link : a live URL or hosted demo."
> "Presentation slides : a Google Drive link to a .ppt or .keynote file."
> "Submission deadline: 12:00am on 8 October (submit by 11:59pm on 7 October). No late entries allowed. Partner tracks may ask for extra material such as a demo video or a short write-up; check the track page."

The JSON field `submission_deadline` is `2026-10-07T15:59:00+00:00`, which is 23:59 SGT on 7 October.

**Stage rules:**
> "Slide format: .ppt or .keynote only. Google Slides, Gamma or Vercel page links are not accepted; they won't play reliably on stage."
> "Demo footage: Live demos are prohibited to avoid technical errors on stage. Use a screen recording and embed the video directly in your slides. Do not link to YouTube or external video."
> "Locked at submission: No changes after the deadline, so make sure your deck is stage-ready before you submit."
> FAQ: "No late entries are allowed, and slides are locked once you submit."

**Eligibility:**
> "Built during Origins. All submitted projects must be built entirely within the 36-hour Origins Hackathon. Projects, prototypes or substantial code developed before the official start are not eligible. Publicly available libraries, frameworks, APIs and developer tooling may of course be used."
> "Meaningful integration. Projects competing for a partner track or prize must meaningfully integrate the relevant partner technology into the core functionality of the project. Superficial integrations added solely to qualify will not be considered eligible."
> token2049.com FAQ: "Teams can have a maximum of 4 members." and "all project work must begin after the official hacking period starts. You can brainstorm ideas, but no code, designs, or prototypes before kickoff."

**Main-track judging:** 30% Functionality & Execution, 25% Technical Implementation & Integration, 20% Innovation & Originality, 15% Usefulness & Potential Impact, 10% Demo & Presentation. The event JSON also has `"auto_ai_evaluation": true`: an automated first pass probably reads the repository and the submission text, so the README must state the problem, the mechanism, the results and the CRE evidence plainly.

**Chainlink "Best workflow with CRE" track page:**
> "To qualify: Build, simulate or deploy a CRE Workflow that's used as an orchestration layer within your project. Integrate at least one blockchain with an external API, system, data source, LLM or AI agent. Demonstrate a successful simulation (via the CRE CLI) or a live deployment on the CRE network."
> Judging: "40% Blockchain: How valuable this project is for decentralization and adoption of Blockchain and Web3. 40% Effective use of CRE: How they use CRE. 20% WOW Factor: The judges' personal evaluation of the project."
> Submission: "Submit to the main track for the Top 5, then add this track." and "Evidence of a successful CRE simulation or deployment : demo video, terminal output, execution logs or deployment details."
> FAQ: "Anything that proves the workflow ran: a demo video, terminal output of the simulation, execution logs or deployment details. Add it to the 'Evidence of a successful CRE simulation or deployment' field when you submit."
> FAQ: "CRE has EVM and Solana clients" (used in the "why not Solana" answer).

**Terms and Conditions 6.4:** "Participants must not include confidential information, personal data or third-party materials unless they are authorised to do so." The deck therefore cites only public papers, our own lab numbers, and one pre-hackathon measurement of public on-chain data, dated as such (speaker notes of slide 2).

**Open format question:** the rules say ".ppt or .keynote"; this plan produces a `.pptx` (PowerPoint's current format; the legacy `.ppt` format cannot reliably embed MP4). Task 12 asks an organizer to confirm `.pptx`, and Task 17 Step 6 is the Keynote fallback, run when `.pptx` is refused or no organizer has answered.

## Inputs this plan consumes (contracts with plans 01 to 05)

Task 12 runs `npm run check`, which prints OK, MISSING or INVALID for each input. If another plan wrote a different shape, change that plan's output or the matching spec in `docs/submission/src/inputs.mjs` (one place), and log the change.

| File | Written by | Shape this plan reads |
|---|---|---|
| `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` | plan 01 deploy scripts, shape fixed by plan 04 ("Contracts with other plans" 1) | Read generically: every `0x` + 40-hex string is listed in the README with its JSON path as label (`riskDesks.live`, `hooks.live`, `tokens.tETH.address`, ...), `null` entries are skipped, risk desks are the addresses whose path contains `desk`, pool ids the values under a `poolId` key. |
| `shared/params.json` | plan 03 (lab decision) | `{ pStar, etaE4, sqrtHalfDtE6, feeMinPips, feeMaxPips, feeSafePips, tauKillSec, decidedBy }` are read; the lab also writes `staticFeePips`, `replayStaticFeePips` and `decidedAt` (ignored here). Plan 04 checks `|etaE4 - round((1/pStar - 0.824) * 1e4)| <= 1`. |
| `shared/src/units.ts` | plan 04 Task 2 | `feePips`, `pipsToBp`, `annualSigmaToSigmaE9`, `sigmaE9ToAnnual`, `SECONDS_PER_YEAR` (the TypeScript mirror of `ClimFeeMath`). |
| `lab/out/backtest-summary.json` | plan 03 | Schema `clim.lab.backtest/1` exactly as plan 03 writes it (its "Output contracts"; the app reads the separate `lab/out/summary.json`), **including three fields this plan needs**: `lpGainPctPerYear.volatileAssetHigh` (percent of capital per year: the main (aggregator) scenario on the same year with every return doubled, not an upper bound), `lpGainPctPerYear.top5WeeksSharePct` (percent of the main scenario's ETH year gain earned in the five stormiest weeks; the README reads that gain from `yearAttribution.clim_p<P* in %>.gainVsStatic5BpYr` when present), `inPoolVolGainSharePct {low, high}` (percent of the gain a pool-internal volatility captures), plus `replayWindowsMedianPct` and `replayWindowsBetterCount` (the median of the rolling 4 h windows and how many beat the static pool, so the replay window is never shown without its context). Plan 03 writes them (validated against `BACKTEST_SPEC`). Every value is rounded at display time (shares to whole percent, %/yr of capital and ratios to 2 decimals): the lab writes 8 significant digits. |
| `lab/out/validation.json` | plan 03 Task 19 | Schema `clim.lab.validation/1`: `pStar`, `windowBlocks`, `nSimsTotal`, `samples[]` of `{name, blocks, pTradeObserved, pTradePredicted, simPValueTwoSided, zones.simulated {green, yellow, red}}` (validated against `VALIDATION_SPEC`). The README's "Where the model is weak" reads it, and deck slide 06 shows the same numbers (typed in Figma, source named in its notes): the largest observed/predicted gap, the simulated alert zones and the significance of the gap. |
| `lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json` | plan 03 | Schema `clim.lab.replay/1` as plan 03 writes it (one file carries this plan's `points[]` and plan 05's columnar arrays): `window`, `params` (with `staticFeePips`), `units.arb`, `points[]` of `{t, price, sigmaAnnualPct, feeVBp, feeSBp, cumArbV, cumArbS}`, `summary` (`arbChangePct`, `pTradeObsV`, `pTradePredV`, ...). Computed at the deployed parameters. Not the same file as `lab/out/replay-window.json` (plan 03's price series for plan 04's replay server). |
| `bots/out/cre-sim/<pair>-<run start>.log` | plan 04 Task 17 (`bun run cre-loop`) | One transcript per `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` run (the loop's `[USER LOG]` lines: `node:` venues, `consensus:` sigma and dispersion, `Write report transaction succeeded: 0x<64 hex>`, `REPORT applied ... tx=0x...`; plan 04 contract 6). Ignored by git; the full CLI logs are in `cre/logs/`. |
| `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl`, `bots/out/security-demos.jsonl` | plan 04 | Tracked by git (plan 04's `.gitignore` exceptions); linked from `docs/evidence/README.md`. |
| `bots` scripts | plan 04 | `cre-loop --pair live`, `arb --pair live`, `noise --pair live`, `status --pair live --watch`, `forge-report --pair live`, `replay-server`, `ENV_FILE=.env.replay cre-loop --pair replay` (the replay desk has its own operator key, plan 01 Task 18); run-book `docs/runbook.md` (plan 04 Task 22). |
| Dashboard | plan 05 | Live view (desk, hook mode, fee of V and S, swaps), the 4 February replay view, the lab view (P_trade against its band, both comparisons), and the live URL on Vercel, copied by hand into `docs/submission/links.json` in Task 12. |
| `cre/project.yaml` | plan 02 | Targets `staging-settings` (live) and `replay-settings`; workflow folder `cre/risk-desk`, run from `cre/`. |

## Deviations from the canonical layout (explicit)

- `docs/submission/`: submission tooling (README generator, evidence collector, CRE evidence text, deck assembler and its Figma exports, README figure). Generated files and the stage cut of the demo video go to `docs/submission/out/` (gitignored).
- `docs/evidence/`: committed CRE evidence for judges (on-chain report list and the workflow's log lines from a few simulate runs).
- `docs/media/`: committed README figure.
- `.gitignore`: plan 04 Task 1 narrows `out/` to `app/out/` (so `lab/out/` is tracked) and ignores `bots/out/*` except its two evidence files. Task 1 here only adds `docs/submission/out/` (deck and video, too large for git), applying plan 04's edit first if it has not run yet.
- This plan owns `README.md` and `docs/faq.md`. If an earlier plan created a stub, Task 10 and Task 11 replace it and keep any extra FAQ entry the stub had.

## File structure

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `.gitignore` | Modify: ignore `docs/submission/out/` (Task 1). |
| `docs/submission/package.json` | Node package for the submission tooling (scripts: `test`, `check`, `check:final`, `evidence`, `readme`, `deck`, `deck:draft`, `evidence:text`, `scan`). |
| `docs/submission/links.json` | Repo, live, deck and video URLs (filled as they exist). |
| `docs/submission/team.json` | Team members shown in the README (the deck's team line, on slide 10, is drawn in Figma). |
| `docs/submission/src/paths.mjs` | Every input and output path, resolved from the repo root. |
| `docs/submission/src/inputs.mjs` | JSON loader, structural specs (lab schemas of plan 05), address walker. |
| `docs/submission/src/lab.mjs` | Facts derived from the lab outputs (replay statistics, severity range). |
| `docs/submission/src/fee.mjs` | Re-exports the fee formula of `shared/src/units.ts`; floor crossover. |
| `docs/submission/src/readme-blocks.mjs` | Renders each generated README block. |
| `docs/submission/src/update-readme.mjs` | CLI: rewrites the README blocks. |
| `docs/submission/src/check-inputs.mjs` | CLI: OK / MISSING / INVALID per input. |
| `docs/submission/src/evidence.mjs` | Event decoding, block ranges, secret scanning, URL redaction. |
| `docs/submission/src/collect-evidence.mjs` | CLI: reads `RiskReported` from Sepolia, copies a few runs' log lines (the loop's per-run files) into `docs/evidence/`. |
| `docs/submission/src/scan-secrets.mjs` | CLI: fails if a tracked file, or any commit's patch on any ref, contains a secret from a `.env` file. |
| `docs/submission/figures/fee_figure.py` | Draws `docs/media/fee-follows-weather.png`. |
| `docs/submission/figures/test_figures.py` | pytest for the figure script. |
| `docs/submission/src/cre-evidence-text.mjs` | CLI (`npm run evidence:text`): prints the CRE-track evidence text with a fresh on-chain report count, at most 1,500 characters. |
| `docs/submission/deck/v2/png/*.png` | The 10 slides (`01-cover.png` to `10-roadmap.png`), exported from the maintainer's Figma file at 1x (3840 x 2160 frames). |
| `docs/submission/deck/v2/slides.json` | Per slide: PNG, Figma node, title, on-slide text, speaker notes. The source of truth for the deck content. |
| `docs/submission/deck/v2/live.json` | Live report count and read time shown on slide 07. |
| `docs/submission/deck/build-deck.mjs` | CLI (`npm run deck`, `npm run deck:draft`) and `buildDeck()`: PNGs, notes and the stage video into `out/clim.pptx`, under 95 MB. |
| `docs/submission/out/video/demo-stage.mp4` | The 30-second stage cut of the maintainer's demo video (gitignored), dropped in by hand (Task 16), embedded on slide 08. The full video is not in the repository: it goes on Google Drive (Task 18), and its link is the Project link. |
| `docs/submission/test/*.test.mjs`, `test/fixtures/*.json` | Unit tests and fixtures. |
| `docs/evidence/README.md`, `cre-reports-sepolia.json`, `cre-simulate-*.log` | CRE evidence. |
| `docs/media/fee-follows-weather.png` | The README picture. |
| `README.md` | Judge-facing README. |
| `LICENSE` | MIT, (c) 2026 Sofiane Ben Taleb; vendored and submodule code keeps its own license. |
| `docs/faq.md` | Precise answers, including the mentor's two questions. |
| `docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md` | Modify: send-ready final pass. |
| `docs/sessions/<date>.md` | Append decisions and feedback. |

Removed on 2026-10-07 (commit `1a53016`) when the deck moved to Figma and the maintainer chose to record the video himself: `figures/video_cards.py`, `scripts/build-video.sh`, `deck/style.mjs`, `deck/data.mjs` and `deck/slides.mjs`. Tasks 7 to 9 keep their history; nothing recreates them.

The test fixtures contain the numbers known on 2026-10-06 (P* = 10% runs; the per-period split of the equal-trader-cost comparison and the `arbOverLvr` values are made up to fit the known ranges). They exist only for tests; the CLIs never read `test/fixtures/`.

## Order and gates

- **Tasks 1 to 11 can start right away**, in parallel with plans 01 to 05: they only use fixtures. They are delegable. Exception: Task 3 (and Tasks 4 and 9, which import it) needs plan 04 Task 2 (`shared/src/units.ts`).
- **Gate C (from the master plan):** contracts deployed and recorded in `shared/deployments/sepolia.json` (master Gate B); `shared/params.json` decided by the lab (master Gate A); the CRE loop has been writing reports with `--broadcast` for at least an hour; the bots trade on pools V and S; `lab/out/backtest-summary.json` and `lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json` computed at the deployed parameters (with the three extra fields of Task 2 Step 5); the dashboard deployed with a live URL. Tasks 12 to 23 need Gate C.
- **Never-cut list for this plan:** CRE evidence (Task 13), README (Tasks 10, 14), deck with an embedded recording (Tasks 15 to 17), Drive link and submission (Tasks 18 to 21). If time runs short, cut in this order: the full video (since the 10-slide cut it is not embedded, only uploaded to Drive as the Project link; without it, the Project link is the live URL, and the 30-second stage video on slide 08 stays), the clean-clone smoke test (keep the secret scan).

### Task 1: Ignore the deck output and scaffold the submission package

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** plan 00 initial commit (the repository has a first commit)

**Files:**
- Modify: `.gitignore`
- Create: `docs/submission/package.json`, `docs/submission/links.json`, `docs/submission/team.json`
- Create (generated): `docs/submission/package-lock.json`

- [x] **Step 1: See what `.gitignore` does today**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && grep -n -E "^out/$|^app/out/$|^bots/out/\*$|^docs/submission/out/$" .gitignore
```
- If the output contains `out/` alone: plan 04 Task 1 has not run. Apply plan 04 Task 1 Step 4 exactly now (replace `out/` with `app/out/` in the `# Node / Next / Bun` block, and insert before `# OS` the block `# Bots: run logs stay local, except the CRE run log and the security demo records (submission evidence)` / `bots/out/*` / `!bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` / `!bots/out/security-demos.jsonl`), and log it as plan 04 asks.
- If it already shows `app/out/` and `bots/out/*`: go on.

- [x] **Step 2: Ignore the deck and video output**

In the `# Node / Next / Bun` block, add the line `docs/submission/out/` right after `app/out/`.

- [x] **Step 3: Check the result**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git check-ignore -v lab/out/backtest-summary.json; echo "exit=$?"; git check-ignore -v docs/submission/out/clim.pptx bots/out/cre-sim/x.log; git check-ignore bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl; echo "exit=$?"
```
Expected:
```
exit=1
.gitignore:<n>:docs/submission/out/	docs/submission/out/clim.pptx
.gitignore:<n>:bots/out/*	bots/out/cre-sim/x.log
exit=1
```
(`exit=1` means not ignored: `lab/out/` is tracked, and `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` (with `bots/out/security-demos.jsonl`) can be committed; both stay untracked until Task 13 Step 5 commits them with the evidence (checked 2026-10-07); `<n>` are line numbers.)

- [x] **Step 4: Create the package and the two small data files**

`docs/submission/package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "clim-submission",
  "private": true,
  "license": "MIT",
  "type": "module",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=22"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node --test test/*.test.mjs",
    "check": "node src/check-inputs.mjs",
    "check:final": "node src/check-inputs.mjs --final",
    "evidence": "node src/collect-evidence.mjs",
    "readme": "node src/update-readme.mjs",
    "deck": "node deck/build-deck.mjs",
    "scan": "node src/scan-secrets.mjs",
    "deck:draft": "node deck/build-deck.mjs --allow-missing-video",
    "evidence:text": "node src/cre-evidence-text.mjs"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "pptxgenjs": "4.0.1",
    "viem": "2.57.3"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "image-size": "2.0.4"
  }
}
```

`docs/submission/links.json` (the empty URLs are filled in Tasks 12 and 18; `npm run check:final` refuses empty ones; `liveUrl` is the deployed dashboard, wired to Sepolia since 2026-10-07. Until then a `liveMockData: true` flag made the README say "mock data until wired to Sepolia" next to it; Task 12 deleted the flag, and the code that read it was removed on 2026-10-07):
```json
{
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/DVB-ANS/clim",
  "liveUrl": "https://clim-zeta.vercel.app",
  "deckUrl": "",
  "videoUrl": ""
}
```

`docs/submission/team.json` (Task 12 asks the maintainer who is on the registered Builderbase team; one object per registered member, `github` may be `""`, `linkedin` is optional and shown in the README's team table):
```json
[
  { "name": "Sofiane Ben Taleb", "github": "gamween", "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiane-ben-taleb/", "role": "Design, contracts, CRE workflow, lab, dashboard" }
]
```

Then install (this is a standalone npm package, outside the root Bun workspace, like `app/`):
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm install
```
Expected: `added <n> packages` and no error. `node_modules/` is already ignored by the root `.gitignore`.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add .gitignore docs/submission/package.json docs/submission/package-lock.json docs/submission/links.json docs/submission/team.json && git commit -m "chore(submission): scaffold submission tooling, ignore its build output"
```

### Task 2: Input loaders, structural checks and lab facts

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 1

The two lab schemas are the ones plan 03 writes (its "Output contracts": `backtest-summary.json` and the `points[]` part of `replay-2026-02-04.json`), so the README, the deck and the app show the same numbers. The fixtures follow plan 04's deployments shape and plan 03's lab shapes.

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/submission/src/paths.mjs`, `docs/submission/src/inputs.mjs`, `docs/submission/src/lab.mjs`
- Create: `docs/submission/test/fixtures/sepolia.json`, `params.json`, `backtest-summary.json`, `replay.json`, `validation.json`, `links.json`, `team.json`, `evidence.json`
- Test: `docs/submission/test/inputs.test.mjs`, `docs/submission/test/lab.test.mjs`

### Task 3: Fee helpers on top of the shared fee mirror

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 1; plan 04 Task 2 (`shared/src/units.ts`)

The README fee schedule must show exactly what the hook charges. The formula lives once, in `shared/src/units.ts` (plan 04's mirror of `ClimFeeMath`, which plan 04's `status.ts` compares with the deployed hook on every block). Node 22 imports that TypeScript file directly (type stripping, checked with Node 22.20.0), so `fee.mjs` only re-exports it and adds the floor crossover. The tests below double as a second check of the shared mirror: with `ceil`, 48%/yr at `etaE4 = 91,761` gives **1,922** pips (1,921.2 before rounding up), not 1,921.

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/submission/src/fee.mjs`

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && node --test test/fee.test.mjs`
Expected: FAIL with `Cannot find module '.../docs/submission/src/fee.mjs'`.

- [x] **Step 3: Implement**

`docs/submission/src/fee.mjs`:
```js
// Fee helpers for the README. The formula itself lives in shared/src/units.ts (plan 04), the TypeScript
// mirror of ClimFeeMath that the bots also use (the app ships its own port, app/src/lib/feeMath.ts); Node 22 imports it directly (type stripping).
export {
  SECONDS_PER_YEAR,
  feePips,
  pipsToBp,
  annualSigmaToSigmaE9 as sigmaE9FromAnnual,
  sigmaE9ToAnnual as annualFromSigmaE9,
} from "../../../shared/src/units.ts";
import { SECONDS_PER_YEAR } from "../../../shared/src/units.ts";

// Annual volatility (fraction) above which the formula rises above the floor.
export function floorCrossoverAnnual({ etaE4, sqrtHalfDtE6, feeMinPips }) {
  return (feeMinPips / 1e6 / ((etaE4 / 1e4) * (sqrtHalfDtE6 / 1e6))) * Math.sqrt(SECONDS_PER_YEAR);
}
```

- [x] **Step 4: Run, expect PASS**

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && node --test test/fee.test.mjs`
Expected: `# pass 5`, `# fail 0`. A failure here with `shared/src/units.ts` present means the shared mirror changed: the shared mirror and the contract are the reference, fix the expectation only after checking plan 04's test vectors, and log it.

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/submission/src/fee.mjs docs/submission/test/fee.test.mjs && git commit -m "feat(submission): fee helpers on the shared fee mirror"

### Task 5: Input checker CLI

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 2

Glue only (the checks themselves are tested in Task 2), so no new unit test.

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/submission/src/check-inputs.mjs`

- [x] **Step 1: Write the CLI**

`docs/submission/src/check-inputs.mjs`:
```js
// Prints OK / MISSING / INVALID for every input of the README generator (deck v2 is checked by deck/build-deck.mjs, which reads deck/v2/slides.json and live.json). Usage: node src/check-inputs.mjs [--final]
import { existsSync } from "node:fs";
import path from "node:path";
import { P, REPO_ROOT } from "./paths.mjs";
import { readJson, check, schemaErrors, provisionalErrors, PARAMS_SPEC, BACKTEST_SPEC, BACKTEST_SCHEMA, REPLAY_SPEC, REPLAY_SCHEMA, VALIDATION_SPEC, VALIDATION_SCHEMA, LINKS_SPEC, TEAM_SPEC, EVIDENCE_SPEC, linkErrors, collectAddresses, deskAddresses } from "./inputs.mjs";

const final = process.argv.includes("--final");
const items = [
  [P.deployments, (d) => [
    ...(collectAddresses(d).addresses.length ? [] : ["no 0x address found"]),
    ...(deskAddresses(d).length ? [] : ["no address under a key containing 'desk'"]),
  ]],
  [P.replayDesk, (d) => (/^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$/.test(d.simOperator ?? "") ? [] : ["simOperator: not a 0x address"])],
  [P.params, (d) => [...check(PARAMS_SPEC, d), ...provisionalErrors(d)]],
  [P.backtest, (d) => [...schemaErrors(d, BACKTEST_SCHEMA), ...check(BACKTEST_SPEC, d)]],
  [P.replay, (d) => [...schemaErrors(d, REPLAY_SCHEMA), ...check(REPLAY_SPEC, d)]],
  [P.validation, (d) => [...schemaErrors(d, VALIDATION_SCHEMA), ...check(VALIDATION_SPEC, d)]],
  [P.links, (d) => [...check(LINKS_SPEC, d), ...linkErrors(d, { final })]],
  [P.team, (d) => check(TEAM_SPEC, d)],
  [P.evidence, (d) => check(EVIDENCE_SPEC, d)],
];

let bad = 0;
for (const [file, validate] of items) {
  const name = path.relative(REPO_ROOT, file);
  if (!existsSync(file)) {
    bad++;
    console.log(`MISSING ${name}`);
    continue;
  }
  let errors;
  try {
    errors = validate(readJson(file));
  } catch (e) {
    errors = [`cannot parse: ${e.message}`];
  }
  if (errors.length) {

  } else {
    console.log(`OK      ${name}`);
  }
}
process.exit(bad ? 1 : 0);
```

- [x] **Step 2: Run it on the real repo**

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run check; echo "exit=$?"`
Expected before Gate C: one line per input (OK, MISSING, or INVALID followed by the reasons) and `exit=1`. For example after plan 04 Task 6 (infrastructure addresses and the provisional `params.json` committed) and before plan 01 deploys:
```
INVALID shared/deployments/sepolia.json
  - no address under a key containing 'desk'
INVALID shared/params.json
  - params.decidedBy is PROVISIONAL: the lab has not decided P* yet
MISSING lab/out/backtest-summary.json
MISSING lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json
MISSING lab/out/validation.json
OK      docs/submission/links.json
OK      docs/submission/team.json
MISSING docs/evidence/cre-reports-sepolia.json
exit=1
```

- [x] **Step 3: Check the final mode**

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run check:final | grep -A3 links.json`
Expected (with `links.json` as of 2026-10-07: dashboard URL set and wired to Sepolia; the `liveMockData` check that printed a third line here was removed with the flag):
```
INVALID docs/submission/links.json
  - links.deckUrl: must be an https:// URL before submission, got ""
  - links.videoUrl: must be an https:// URL before submission, got ""
```

- [x] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/submission/src/check-inputs.mjs && git commit -m "feat(submission): input checker CLI"
```

### Task 6: CRE evidence collector

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 2

Reads every `RiskReported` event of every desk since kickoff (2026-10-06 04:00 UTC) in 5,000-block chunks (the public RPC answered `pruned history unavailable` for a 50,000-block range on 2026-10-06, and 10,000 worked), writes `docs/evidence/cre-reports-sepolia.json`, and copies the newest transcripts that contain a transaction hash, after redacting RPC keys and the home directory and refusing any file that contains a secret from a `.env` file. The same helpers power `npm run scan`, which fails if any tracked file contains such a secret.

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/submission/src/evidence.mjs`, `docs/submission/src/collect-evidence.mjs`, `docs/submission/src/scan-secrets.mjs`
- Test: `docs/submission/test/evidence.test.mjs`

### Task 7: README figure and video cards (Python)

> **Superseded in part on 2026-10-07 (commit `1a53016`).** Why: the maintainer decided that the demo video is him on camera, in his own words, then a live demo, with no AI video and no screen-only cut (session log 2026-10-07, Decisions "Demo video"), so the video title cards and captions have no use. Removed: `figures/video_cards.py` and its test. Kept: the README figure, `figures/fee_figure.py` (Task 14 draws it from real data); `figures/test_figures.py` now tests only it (Step 4 now gives `1 passed`). What replaced the cards: the maintainer's own recording (Tasks 15 and 16). The `video_cards.py` code below is history: do not recreate it.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 2 (fixtures)

uv fetches matplotlib, Pillow and pytest into a throwaway environment (`--no-project`), so this does not touch the lab's own environment. The fonts are macOS system fonts.

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/submission/figures/fee_figure.py`, `docs/submission/figures/video_cards.py`
- Test: `docs/submission/figures/test_figures.py`

- [x] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

`docs/submission/figures/test_figures.py`:
```python
import json
import os

from PIL import Image

from fee_figure import make_fee_figure

HERE = os.path.dirname(__file__)


def test_fee_figure_is_1600x900(tmp_path):
    with open(os.path.join(HERE, "..", "test", "fixtures", "replay.json")) as f:
        replay = json.load(f)
    out = tmp_path / "fee.png"
    make_fee_figure(replay, str(out))
    assert Image.open(out).size == (1600, 900)
```
(Until `1a53016` this file also imported `video_cards` and had a second test, `test_cards_and_captions`, removed with the video cards.)

- [x] **Step 2: Run it, expect FAIL**

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && uv run --no-project --with "matplotlib>=3.9,<3.11" --with "pillow>=10" --with "pytest>=8" pytest docs/submission/figures -q -p no:warnings --rootdir docs/submission/figures
```
Expected: FAIL, `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fee_figure'`.

- [x] **Step 3: Implement both scripts**

Run the same pytest command as Step 2. Expected: `1 passed` (`2 passed` before the video cards were removed in `1a53016`; checked again on 2026-10-07).

Then draw the figure from the fixture and open it with the Read tool:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && mkdir -p docs/submission/out && uv run --no-project --with "matplotlib>=3.9,<3.11" python docs/submission/figures/fee_figure.py docs/submission/test/fixtures/replay.json docs/submission/out/fee-fixture.png
```
Expected: `wrote docs/submission/out/fee-fixture.png`; the image shows a blue volatility line on top and an amber step line with a grey dashed flat line below, titled "4 February 2026: the storm arrives, the fee follows".

- [x] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/submission/figures && git commit -m "feat(submission): README fee figure and video title cards"
```

### Task 8: Video build script

> **Superseded on 2026-10-07 (commit `1a53016`).** Why: the same decision of the maintainer (session log 2026-10-07, Decisions "Demo video"): he records and edits the two cuts himself, so there are no raw shots to assemble. Removed: `scripts/build-video.sh` (the whole `scripts/` folder). What replaced it: the maintainer exports `docs/submission/out/video/demo-stage.mp4` and `demo-full.mp4` himself (Tasks 15 and 16), and `deck/build-deck.mjs` (`npm run deck`, Task 17) re-encodes them to H.264 and AAC with their sound when needed so the .pptx stays under 95 MB. The script below is history: do not recreate it.

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 7

The Homebrew ffmpeg on this Mac has no `drawtext` or `subtitles` filter (checked 2026-10-06), so captions are PNG overlays from Task 7. Every shot is recorded as its own file; the script normalizes each one to 1920x1080 at 30 fps (padding with the deck's night colour), overlays its caption, cuts it to a cap (`trim`) or time-lapses it to the cap (`fit`, used for the 3-minute blind-mode wait and the replay), adds title cards and concatenates two cuts: the full demo (about 2.5 minutes) and the stage cut (about 78 s) embedded on slide 6. `-nostdin` matters: without it ffmpeg eats the shot list and the loop breaks.

### Task 9: Deck builder

> **Superseded on 2026-10-07 (commit `1a53016`).** Why: the maintainer rejected deck v1 and decided that the slides are designed in his Figma file, exported as PNGs and assembled into a .pptx with the embedded video and speaker notes (session log 2026-10-07, Decisions "Deck design", "Deck pipeline" and "Deck v1 rejected"). Removed: the native pptxgenjs deck, `deck/style.mjs`, `deck/data.mjs` and `deck/slides.mjs` (22 slides with native charts). What replaced it:
> - `deck/v2/png/`: 20 slides from Figma file `LyeDZ1KdOYws6nTzD8dI76`, section `162:2`, exported at 2x (3840 x 2160);
> - `deck/v2/slides.json`: per slide the PNG, the Figma node, the title, the on-slide text and the speaker notes (the spoken part, then "Sources (not read aloud): ...");
> - `deck/v2/live.json`: the live report count and its read time, used on slides 09 and 19;
> - `deck/build-deck.mjs`, rewritten: `npm run deck` puts each PNG full-bleed with alt text and notes "Slide text: ..." followed by the speaker notes, embeds `out/video/demo-stage.mp4` full-bleed on slide 10 and `demo-full.mp4` on slide 20 (re-encoded with sound when needed so the .pptx stays under 95 MB; Drive previews up to 100 MB) and writes `out/clim.pptx`; `npm run deck:draft` builds without videos;
> - `src/cre-evidence-text.mjs`: `npm run evidence:text` prints the CRE-track evidence text with a fresh on-chain count (at most 1,500 characters);
> - tests: `test/deck.test.mjs` (rewritten, 4 tests) and `test/cre-evidence-text.test.mjs` (1 test); `npm test` passes 40.
>
> **Cut to 10 slides later on 2026-10-07** (the maintainer's decision, after a Chainlink judge said judges read the slides simply, want CRE explained a bit and like a slide with our CRE feedback; session log 2026-10-07): the frames to export are Figma section `198:2` "clim° deck · 10 slides (export these frames)", section `162:2` is archived as "archive · deck v2, 20 slides (not exported)" (both sections were deleted that evening, when the maintainer moved the 10 frames to his group `204:320`, 3840 x 2160, exported at 1x: see Task 17), and `deck/v2/png/` holds `01-cover.png` to `10-roadmap.png` (the 18 PNGs no longer used were removed with `git rm`; `01-cover.png` and `02-origin.png` kept their names). There is no appendix: its content is in the speaker notes. `build-deck.mjs` embeds only `demo-stage.mp4`, full-bleed on slide 08, with the whole size budget, and refuses to build without it unless `--allow-missing-video`; the full video goes on Google Drive as the Project link. `test/deck.test.mjs` keeps 4 tests (10 slides, one mp4 on slide 08, the refusal without the stage video, every note with "Slide text:" and "Sources (not read aloud):"), so `npm test` still passes 40.
>
> The steps below are the history of the v1 builder: do not recreate `style.mjs`, `data.mjs` or `slides.mjs`. The final build and its checks are Task 17; the slide list is "Deck content, slide by slide".

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Tasks 2, 3

Load the `anthropic-skills:pptx` skill before this task; its gotchas are applied in the code (layout set first, hex colours without `#`, a fresh options object per chart, `isTextBox` on every free text box, notes through `addNotes`, sections, layouts with placeholders, native charts). The deck is dark throughout ("storm night"), Calibri only (safe font), 13.33 x 7.5 in. Colours are written as hex rather than scheme colours, so the skill's `apply_theme.js` step is not needed. The slide-by-slide content is in the section "Deck content, slide by slide" below.

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/submission/deck/style.mjs`, `docs/submission/deck/data.mjs`, `docs/submission/deck/slides.mjs`, `docs/submission/deck/build-deck.mjs`

- [x] **Step 7: Run, expect PASS, then the whole suite**

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && node --test test/deck.test.mjs`
Expected: `# pass 4`, `# fail 0`.
Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm test`
Expected: `# pass 39`, `# fail 0`.

- [x] **Step 8: QA a fixture deck with the pptx skill**

Build a draft from the fixtures (no video yet) and validate it with the pptx skill's validator, found on disk (on this Mac it is under `~/.claude/skills/synced/.../pptx/scripts/office/validate.py`).
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && node --input-type=module -e "import('./deck/build-deck.mjs').then(({buildDeck}) => buildDeck({params:'test/fixtures/params.json',backtest:'test/fixtures/backtest-summary.json',replay:'test/fixtures/replay.json',validation:'test/fixtures/validation.json',links:'test/fixtures/links.json',team:'test/fixtures/team.json'}, 'out/clim-fixture.pptx', {allowMissingVideo:true})).then(f => console.log('wrote', f))"
V=$(find ~/.claude -path '*pptx*/scripts/office/validate.py' -print -quit) && test -n "$V" && echo "validator: $V" && uv run --no-project --with defusedxml --with lxml python "$V" /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/clim-fixture.pptx
uvx --from 'markitdown[pptx]' markitdown /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/clim-fixture.pptx > /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/clim-fixture.md && grep -c "Slide number" /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/clim-fixture.md
```
Expected: `wrote out/clim-fixture.pptx`, `validator: <path>`, `All validations PASSED!`, `22`. If no validator is found (the `find` prints nothing and the chain stops), skip validation and rely on markitdown and the visual pass of Step 9; log it.

- [x] **Step 9: Visual QA**

LibreOffice is not installed on this Mac. Run it without installing it (checked on 2026-10-06 with 26.8.1; the download is about 300 MB): 
```bash
D=$(mktemp -d) && curl -sSL -o $D/lo.dmg https://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/26.8.1/mac/aarch64/LibreOffice_26.8.1_MacOS_aarch64.dmg && mkdir -p $D/mnt && hdiutil attach -nobrowse -mountpoint $D/mnt $D/lo.dmg
$D/mnt/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/clim-fixture.pptx
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out && find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'slide-*.jpg' -delete && pdftoppm -jpeg -r 80 clim-fixture.pdf slide && ls -1 "$PWD"/slide-*.jpg
```
If version 26.8.1 is gone, take the current one from https://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/. If the redirect lands on a slow mirror (on 2026-10-06 it picked one at about 35 KB/s), take a faster one from the same URL plus `.mirrorlist` (`https://mirror.fcix.net/tdf/libreoffice/stable/26.8.1/mac/aarch64/LibreOffice_26.8.1_MacOS_aarch64.dmg` ran at about 1 MB/s) and compare `shasum -a 256` with the URL plus `.sha256`. Shells reset between agent calls, so print `$D` and reuse the literal path. Keep `$D/mnt` mounted for Task 17 (`hdiutil detach $D/mnt` when done). `find ... -delete` replaces `rm -f slide-*.jpg`, which aborts in zsh when nothing matches.
Open every image with the Read tool (or dispatch a subagent to look at them fresh) and fix in `slides.mjs`, never by hand: text overflow, overlaps, titles at different heights, low contrast, a number split from its unit. LibreOffice substitutes Calibri with Carlito (same metrics), so text fit is reliable. The "VIDEO MISSING" boxes on slides 6 and 21 are expected for this draft.

The references on slide 22 and in the README were checked: Kupiec (1995) is *The Journal of Derivatives* 3(2), 73-84 (Crossref record of DOI 10.3905/jod.1995.407942, read 2026-10-06; spec Appendix A).

### Task 10: README draft

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 4

**Files:**
- Create or replace: `README.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Write the README**

Replace the whole of `README.md` with the text below. The `<!-- clim:begin X -->` / `<!-- clim:end X -->` pairs are filled by `npm run readme`; never edit between them by hand.

The text follows the maintainer's house style (the pinned repositories patapim, Wafer, Build-Show-with-the-Ledger-Agent-Stack, DVB-ANS/Metaphor and DVB-ANS/Cachemarket): a centered header with one emoji in the H1, a colon tagline, flat-square badges, the event line and the bold link row; a thesis blockquote and an event blockquote; a table of contents grouped on six lines; two mermaid diagrams (the architecture flowchart of commit `baa8a37`, which the maintainer liked rendered, and the "Nobody changes the fee" sequence diagram); "What building it made visible", "What's live vs. simulated", "Files that use Chainlink" and "Roadmap"; a tech stack table, a repository tree, the team and the license. No em dashes in prose, no emoji outside the H1 and the status cells. The markers may move but both markers of every block must stay (`replaceBlock` throws otherwise); inside the centered `<div>`, keep a blank line around the block.

![On 4 February 2026 ETH volatility climbs from calm to storm; clim's fee steps up under it while a fixed-fee pool stays flat](docs/media/fee-follows-weather.png)

*The 4 February 2026 storm replayed with real Binance prices at the deployed parameters
(`lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json`).*

When ETH jumps on Binance, bots buy from a pool at the old price and the liquidity provider (LP)
pays the gap. The fastest bot wins that race: when prices move, speed is what earns, and the LP
pays for it. That loss is small when the market is calm and large in a storm, yet a pool charges
the same fee in both. clim makes speed cost more when it matters: the fee follows the weather. Four exchanges act as four weather
stations that must agree: a Chainlink CRE workflow reads them every 30 seconds and writes one
volatility figure on-chain (from the CRE simulator for now: see
[What's live vs. simulated](#whats-live-vs-simulated)). On every swap, a Uniswap v4 hook turns that
figure into the fee: the pair's usual tier when it is calm, a premium that rises with volatility in
a storm. The model behind the fee makes a prediction anyone can check, how often the pool gets
arbitraged, and clim publishes it and measures it. The live desk has already priced a real storm,
not a replay: on 7 October 2026 ETH volatility reached 242% a year and the clim pool's fee 26.50 bp.

> A liquidity provider is an insurer, and the fee is its premium. It is also the LP's only barrier
> against arbitrage: too low and the LP is picked off in a storm, too high and traders route to the
> pool next door.

> **Built solo in 36 hours at [TOKEN2049 Origins](https://www.token2049.com/singapore/2049-origins), Singapore, 6-8 October 2026.**
> Submitted to the main track and to Chainlink's "Best workflow with CRE", the only partner track we
> entered, on purpose: the product is built around it (the risk desk is the CRE workflow, and
> without a fresh CRE report the hook falls back to the safe fee). That track asks for a CRE
> workflow that is the orchestration layer of the product, connects a blockchain to an external
> API, and has run in simulation or on a DON. The main track weighs functionality and execution
> (30%), technical implementation (25%), innovation (20%), usefulness (15%) and the demo (10%).

```

1. **Risk desk (Chainlink CRE, every 30 s).** Each node converts the venues' one-minute ETH candles
   to USD, drops any venue whose last closed candle is older than 120 s, requires 3 of the 4, and
   computes the 15-minute realized volatility of the median price and the dispersion between venues.
   On a DON, the nodes agree on the median of each field and sign one report. In this build the
   workflow runs in the CRE simulator, on one node, and the operator key sends each report through
   `MockKeystoneForwarder`, which checks no signature. Deribit's DVOL is a diagnostic only.
2. **`RiskDesk.sol`** receives the report through `onReport` from the Chainlink forwarder. It
   rejects reports that come less than 20 s after the previous one, from more than 30 s in the
   future, or from fewer than 3 venues, and it limits how far volatility can move between two
   reports (at most ×2 up, ×0.8 down, always between 10% and 1000% a year). It has no function that
   sets volatility or the fee: its owner picks the forwarder and workflow to trust. In this build the
   owner key is also the operator key (`simOperator`), the only sender whose simulated reports the
   live desk accepts, so that key can post any volatility inside the envelope, and the fee stays
   within the clamp (5 bp floor, 150 bp cap). `disableSim()` alone does not end this: the owner can
   point the desk at a forwarder it controls, so the owner key can post reports until ownership is
   renounced. On a DON, the owner would point the desk at the `KeystoneForwarder` and pin the
   expected workflow ID (`ReceiverTemplate`'s identity checks), and only then call `disableSim()`
   and renounce ownership ([FAQ](docs/faq.md#can-the-owner-change-the-fee)).
3. **`ClimHook.sol`** (Uniswap v4, built on OpenZeppelin's `BaseOverrideFee`). On every swap the
   PoolManager calls `beforeSwap`; the hook reads `RiskDesk.state()` and returns the fee with
   `OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG`. If the desk has been silent for longer than the kill delay (blind) or the
   venues disagree (degraded), the hook quotes at least the safe fee.
4. **Dashboard** ([clim-zeta.vercel.app/app](https://clim-zeta.vercel.app/app), reading Sepolia). From
   `RiskReported` and `Swap` events it shows the desk, the clim pool's fee next to a fixed-fee twin
   pool and how often each one gets arbitraged (`/app`), plus the test-token faucet, the fee before
   a swap (`/swap`), liquidity for either pool (`/lp`) and every contract with its Etherscan and
   Sourcify links.

## How the fee is computed

```
fee = clamp( eta × k × sigma × sqrt(blockTime / 2), floor, cap )
```

- **sigma**: the desk's latest volatility, per square-root second (15-minute realized volatility).
- **sqrt(blockTime / 2)**: scales sigma to the typical price move during half a block, the time an
  arbitrageur waits on average. Sepolia blocks are 12 s.
- **eta**: how many standard deviations of that move the fee covers. With `eta = 1/P* - 0.824`, a
  block gets arbitraged with probability P* once the fee is above the floor (Milionis, Moallemi and
  Roughgarden 2023; Nezlobin and Tassy 2025 for fixed block times); at the floor, in calm markets,
  fewer blocks get arbitraged. The fee is a dial on how often the LP lets itself be picked off.
- **k**: a model-risk multiplier between 1 and 2 that can only make the fee more prudent. In this
  build k = 1: the model check runs in the lab, and `RiskDesk` already clamps k to [1, 2], so
  turning it on is a workflow change.
- **floor** is the pair's market fee tier, so in calm markets clim costs traders what the
  neighbouring pool costs.

On-chain it is integer arithmetic, without logarithms or square roots:
`fee_pips = clamp(ceil(sigmaE9 × etaE4 × sqrtHalfDtE6 × kE4 / 1e17), feeMinPips, feeMaxPips)`
(1 bp = 100 pips).

### Nobody "changes" the fee

No keeper sets the fee: there is no admin call and no fee-update transaction. The fee is
recomputed inside every swap:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant T as Trader
  participant PM as PoolManager
  participant H as ClimHook
  participant D as RiskDesk
  T->>PM: swap(key, params)
  PM->>H: beforeSwap(sender, key, params)
  H->>D: state()
  D-->>H: tObs, sigmaE9, kE4, flags, seq
  Note over H: fee = clamp(eta x k x sigma x sqrt(blockTime/2), floor, cap)<br/>blind or degraded: at least the safe fee
  H-->>PM: selector, zero delta, fee + OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG
  Note over PM: swap priced at that fee, this swap only.<br/>The stored pool fee is never written.<br/>The Swap event records the fee paid.
  PM-->>T: swap settled
```

The pool is created with the dynamic-fee flag (`fee = 0x800000` in its `PoolKey`), which is what
lets the PoolManager take a per-swap fee from the hook. A fee returned with `OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG`
(`0x400000`) applies to that swap only, and the fee each swap paid is in the `fee` field of the
PoolManager's `Swap` event.

## Results

The two comparisons answer different questions: does charging at the right time beat a fixed fee
(same average fee), and does it still win when volume grows with volatility (same cost to traders)?
We always show both, and the 4 February replay window always next to the storm's rolling windows.

## Why Chainlink CRE

clim is built around CRE, which is why it is the only partner track we entered: the risk desk is
the CRE workflow, and without a fresh report the hook falls back to the safe fee. The honest answer
first: a volatility measured inside the pool itself would capture most of the gain (see Results).
CRE is not what makes the number possible. It is what makes it **trustworthy**:

- **Four exchanges must agree.** Nobody can push the fee around with fake trades on the pool, and a
  venue that freezes or diverges is dropped or flags the desk as degraded.
- **On a DON: one signed report, and no single key once the owner renounces.** Reports come
  through Chainlink's `KeystoneForwarder`, which checks the DON's signatures: on a DON, once the
  expected workflow ID is pinned, simulation disabled and ownership renounced, no single key can
  write the desk (until then the owner key can re-point the forwarder). Today, in simulation, the
  operator key submits the reports through `MockKeystoneForwarder`, so that one key is trusted to
  post the volatility, inside the envelope (see [How it works](#how-it-works)).
- **One figure for many pools and chains.** CRE can write the same report to other EVM chains and
  to Solana.
- **Room for model control.** The desk could compare its own prediction with what happens on-chain
  and raise k without anyone touching the hook, once the workflow sends k (k = 1 in this build, see
  the fee above).

A price feed with a 0.5% deviation threshold and a one-hour heartbeat is too coarse for this, and a
pull oracle would let the swapper choose its report. Chainlink does list ETH realized-volatility
Data Feeds, but their shortest window is 24 hours with a one-hour heartbeat (and the Sepolia one
last updated on 2024-08-30): a storm that lasts an hour barely moves them ([FAQ](docs/faq.md)).

| Track requirement | In clim | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A CRE workflow that is the orchestration layer, core to the product | The fee is computed from the desk's report on every swap; without a fresh report the hook falls back to the safe fee | ✅ |
| A blockchain integrated with an external API | Six HTTP sources per node (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, Hyperliquid, Deribit DVOL, Kraken USDT/USD), one report written to `RiskDesk` on Ethereum Sepolia | ✅ |
| A successful simulation with the CRE CLI, or a deployment | `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` every 30 s on Sepolia: to the live desk since 2026-10-06 16:26 UTC; to the replay desk, 459 reports from 17:02 to 20:58 UTC (its loop started at 16:57) | ✅ simulation |
| Beyond the requirement: deployment on a CRE DON | Not done. DON deploy access was requested on 6 October 2026 (22:56 SGT) and not granted during the hackathon (still "Not enabled" on 7 October), so the DON deployment was cut (friction log row 6).

## What building it made visible

We logged CRE frictions as we built: 27 rows in the
[friction log](docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md), 25 of them hit while building and 2 from reading
the docs only, summarized for the Chainlink team in the
[DevEx report](docs/feedback/cre-devex-report.md). The three most useful to Chainlink:

- **The sports-resolution starter's receiver template rejects every report once identity checks
  are on.** Its `ReceiverTemplate.sol` (cre-templates `d0223f3`) requires 62 bytes of metadata, but
  `KeystoneForwarder` and `MockKeystoneForwarder` pass 64 (workflow id 32, name 10, owner 20, report
  id 2), so with an expected workflow id, author or name set, every report reverts
  `InvalidMetadataLength(64, 62)`. Reproduced with a forge test on real forwarder metadata; the
  other templates have no length check, and clim uses the `circuit-breaker` copy. A candidate
  upstream fix: align the template with the docs, which already say 64 (friction log row 23).
- **A rejected report looks like a success.** With `--broadcast`, the simulator reports `SUCCESS`
  whenever the forwarder transaction is mined, and `MockKeystoneForwarder` does not revert when the
  consumer does. A forged report on Sepolia
  ([`0x34ee46a6…53d9`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x34ee46a6947d2831fdb3e5a09f831008589efd9cf099f61dca86dc4cdadc53d9))
  was mined with status 1, `ReportProcessed` false and no `RiskReported`. The docs already say the
  status is always `SUCCESS` in simulation, but give the wrong reason: that the mock does not call
  the consumer's `onReport`, when it does (friction log row 2). The workflow re-reads
  `RiskDesk.state()` after each write to tell the two apart (friction log row 9).
- **Simulation is one node, and it needs the network.** The Sepolia mock forwarder checks no
  signature, so `RiskDesk` only accepts simulated reports sent by the operator key (`tx.origin`),
  and the CLI validates its credentials against the CRE API on every run: 5 of the first 413 runs
  of our two 30 s loops (live and replay) on 2026-10-06 stopped there. On 2026-10-07 a network
  outage on our side stopped 27 live runs at that check, so the live desk went silent and the hook
  charged its 30 bp safe fee, as designed, for about 8 minutes (04:33:00 to 04:40:24 and 04:48:12
  to 04:48:36 UTC, block times); one retail swap paid it. Later that day, with our network up, the
  check also timed out while the CRE API was slow (`context deadline exceeded`), and the live desk
  came within 13 s of blind mode (friction log rows 1 and 24).

## What's live vs. simulated

| Piece | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Contracts on Sepolia | ✅ live | Both desks, both hooks, the clim pools and their fixed-fee twins, test tokens with a public faucet; clim's own contracts are verified on Sourcify ([addresses](#deployed-addresses)) |
| A CRE report every 30 s | ✅ live, from simulation | `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` in a loop since 2026-10-06 16:26 UTC: 444 reports on the live desk (`state().seq`, read 2026-10-06 20:29 UTC). Observation time (tObs) to block: median 14 s, p90 25 s over 211 reports (last 600 blocks to about 18:40 UTC on 2026-10-06) |
| A real storm on the live desk | ✅ live | On 7 October 2026, real market data, not a replay: from 01:58 to 02:51 UTC, 100 of the live desk's 105 reports put the clim pool's fee above the 5 bp floor; volatility peaked at 242% a year and the fee at 26.50 bp (report observed at 02:11 UTC). Every one of the 105 swaps on the clim pool in that window paid exactly the formula's fee for the desk's state (`RiskReported` and `Swap` events read with `cast`) ([/replay#latest](https://clim-zeta.vercel.app/replay#latest)) |
| DON consensus and signature checks | 🛣️ cut | The simulator runs one node and `MockKeystoneForwarder` checks no signature. DON deploy access was requested on 6 October 2026 (22:56 SGT) and not granted during the hackathon (still "Not enabled" on 7 October), so the DON deployment was cut (friction log row 6). The workflow is written with the CRE consensus API for a DON and has not run on one |
| Model-risk multiplier k | 🛣️ off (k = 1) | The model check runs in the lab (`lab/out/validation.json`); `RiskDesk` already clamps k to [1, 2], so turning it on is a workflow change |
| The 4 February 2026 storm | ✅ replayed on Sepolia | Historical Binance prices, served at wall-clock speed by `bots/src/replay-server.ts` to a second CRE loop that writes to the replay desk (its REPLAY flag discloses it). Its loop started at 16:57 UTC on 2026-10-06 and wrote 459 reports, from 17:02 to 20:58 UTC; since then the replay desk is silent and its hook quotes the 30 bp safe fee |
| The market | simulated | Our own arbitrage and retail bots trade the clim pool and its fixed-fee twin. No mainnet pool; volume moving to cheaper pools is only approximated; just-in-time liquidity is not modeled. The arbitrage bot keeps one transaction in flight per pool, so on chain it lands fewer arbitrages than the model's arbitrageur would: on the replay it arbitraged 21.5% of the clim pool's blocks against 29.6% predicted, but counting the 90 blocks it skipped while a trade was pending, it saw the pool outside its no-arbitrage band in 349 of 1,186 blocks (29.4%) |
| Results | simulated | Lab backtests on historical Binance ETHUSDT data (`lab/out/`), not live P&L |
| Dashboard | ✅ live, reads Sepolia | https://clim-zeta.vercel.app: a guided path ("Start here"), the desk and both pools at `/app`, real Sepolia swaps and liquidity at `/swap` and `/lp` (test tokens from the faucet), the 7 October live storm and the finished 4 February replay at `/replay`; numbers checked against `cast` reads |

## Can a pool that is already live use clim?

Not by flipping a switch on an existing pool. Yes for a new pool. A pool that already has a dynamic
fee can follow the desk only if its hook reads an outside source or lets a keeper post the fee.
Details in [docs/faq.md](docs/faq.md).

- A Uniswap v3 pool cannot: `UniswapV3Pool.fee` is `immutable`.
- A Uniswap v4 pool's fee mode and hook are part of its `PoolKey`, and the `PoolKey` is the pool's
  identity. A static-fee pool cannot become dynamic and cannot gain a hook: you create a new pool
  and LPs move their liquidity.
- A pool created with a dynamic fee gets its fee from its own hook, either per swap (`beforeSwap`
  with `OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG`, what clim does) or stored (`PoolManager.updateDynamicLPFee`, which only
  that hook can call).
- A DEX whose fee a keeper posts can use the risk desk without migrating: the keeper reads
  `RiskDesk.state()`. A dynamic-fee v4 pool can too if its hook reads an external source or exposes
  a keeper path to `updateDynamicLPFee`; a hook with fixed logic means a new hook and a new pool.
- clim's own parameters are immutable. A different P* means a new hook and a new pool.

## Roadmap

1. **Existing DEXs plug clim in, Fables on Robinhood Chain first, in shadow mode.** clim is not a
   new DEX. It is a risk desk (the CRE workflow and `RiskDesk`) plus a hook pattern (`ClimHook`)
   that existing protocols plug in: a keeper that posts their fees reads `RiskDesk.state()`, or a
   new pool gets a hook like `ClimHook` (an existing hook only if it can read an outside contract),
   and either applies the fee rule with their own parameters. Fables comes first. Its fees are already presented as
   dynamic, and a keeper moves them: its crypto pools charge a flat fee plus a temporary override
   that the keeper posts between a floor and a cap (our pre-hackathon reading of public on-chain
   data, 2026-09-30). First, clim publishes its recommended fee next to the keeper's, without acting
   on it. Then the keeper reads `RiskDesk.state()`, applies the fee rule with Fables' own P*, floor
   and cap, and posts the result: no contract change on their side. This is our proposal to Fables,
   not an agreement: nothing runs on Robinhood Chain yet.
   We measured Fables' keeper on-chain before proposing it ([`lab/README.md`](lab/README.md#clim-vs-fables-keeper-11-september-2026)):
   it is not a flat fee (it tracks volatility, and it had its 60 bp cap in place at the two scheduled
   US releases we studied, CPI on 11 September and FOMC on 16 September), and on the 11 September
   2026 storm clim's rule lost about 10 % more to arbitrage than the keeper at the same average fee
   in our model, because the keeper posted its cap in the very second of the CPI release, which a
   15-minute volatility measure cannot anticipate. What clim adds is a public, checkable rule fed by
   four exchanges through CRE in place of one private key (fully so once the desk runs on a DON and
   ownership is renounced, item 3; today clim's desk is also written by a single operator key, see
   [How it works](#how-it-works)); the keeper's event overrides can sit on top of the desk's
   measured baseline, which is what the shadow mode would test.
2. **One desk, many chains: Sepolia is the proof, other EVM chains are configuration.** For the
   workflow, another EVM chain that CRE supports is a new target: the chain name and the desk
   address in its config, an RPC in `cre/project.yaml` (a mainnet also needs the `isTestnet` flag in
   `workflow.ts` made configurable). The contracts deploy unchanged, with that chain's block time in
   the hook (the hook needs Uniswap v4 there; a keeper-driven DEX needs only the desk; sub-second
   chains first need a calibrated Δt, see [Limits](#limits)). The same CRE workflow can write the
   same report to a `RiskDesk` on every chain CRE supports, and an off-chain keeper can read a desk
   on any chain without a bridge. CRE lists Robinhood Chain as Robinhood Testnet only (docs,
   2026-09-18), and writes to Solana.
3. **DON deployment.** Deploy access was not granted during the hackathon. Once it is, the workflow
   runs on a DON and reports arrive through the `KeystoneForwarder`. The owner points `RiskDesk` at
   that forwarder and pins the expected workflow ID (`ReceiverTemplate`'s identity checks), and only
   then calls `disableSim()` and renounces ownership or hands it to a timelocked multisig.
4. **Fees that also read volume (a judge's suggestion).** Today the fee reads volatility only.
   Volume would enter through k, the multiplier the desk already sends with sigma in every report,
   so the hook would not change. Each run, the workflow would read the clim pool's recent `Swap`
   events with CRE's EVM client and split that volume into arbitrage (swaps that push the pool's
   price toward the exchanges' median, the trades of Milionis, Moallemi and Roughgarden's
   arbitrageur) and uninformed flow. k would rise with the arbitrage share: a spread pays the market
   maker for trading with better-informed traders (Glosten and Milgrom 1985), and a market maker's
   quotes depend on volatility and on how order arrivals respond to the spread (Avellaneda and
   Stoikov 2008). In this build that can only raise the storm premium: `RiskDesk` clamps k to
   [1, 2], and the floor stays the pair's market tier. Cutting the fee to attract traders when the
   pool lacks volume would need a desk that accepts k below 1, so a new hook and new pools (the
   hook's desk address is immutable). It is not a sure win either: a higher DEX fee can increase
   volume, because it pays LPs to supply depth (Hasbrouck, Rivera and Saleh 2022). Before shipping,
   the lab would backtest it against the same fixed-fee pool, at the same average fee and at the
   same cost to traders, with the same prediction check: with k above 1, the predicted share of
   arbitraged blocks becomes 1/(k × eta + 0.824). Details in the
   [FAQ](docs/faq.md#why-not-set-the-fee-from-volume-too).

## Getting started

You need Foundry, Node.js 22, Bun 1.3.9, the [CRE CLI](https://docs.chain.link/cre), uv (Python)
and, for anything that writes on-chain, a Sepolia RPC URL and funded testnet keys.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DVB-ANS/clim && cd clim
bun install                             # root workspace: shared and bots

(cd contracts && forge test)            # contracts: unit and fuzz tests; without SEPOLIA_RPC_URL in contracts/.env
                                        # (see .env.example) the 3 Sepolia fork tests skip: 73 passed, 2 skipped (75 total)
                                        # (forge counts the 2-test fork suite, skipped in setUp, as one)
(cd lab && uv sync && uv run pytest)    # lab: backtests and model checks; a fresh clone has no lab/data/
                                        # (gitignored): 92 passed, 8 skipped (the 7 tests that read it, and
                                        # the Fables figure test, which needs matplotlib)

# CRE risk desk: one simulated run without a transaction (needs `cre login`)
(cd cre/risk-desk && bun install)
(cd cre && cre workflow simulate risk-desk --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --target staging-settings)

# Dashboard, a standalone npm project (Next.js): copy shared/, lab/out and the FAQ in, then run
(cd app && npm ci && npm run sync && npm run dev)
```

To run the live loop yourself (a CRE report every 30 s with `--broadcast`, plus the arbitrage and
retail bots), put the operator key in `cre/.env` (`CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY`) and the bot keys in
`bots/.env` (see `bots/.env.example`), then, one terminal each:

```bash
(cd bots && bun run cre-loop --pair live)
(cd bots && bun run arb --pair live)
(cd bots && bun run noise --pair live)
(cd bots && bun run status --pair live --watch)
```

[docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md) covers funding, the 4 February replay and the security demos.

## What we tested and rejected

A first design charged a directional toll against a reference price from the desk. We dropped it
during design, at an earlier setting (exploration scripts in `lab/scratch/bt2.py` and `bt3.py`; not
recomputed at the final P*): the reference is at least 30 s old, so an arbitrageur trades against
the stale reference at the low fee; splitting a swap gets around it; in simulation a symmetric fee
did better at equal tracking error; and a directional fee on a Chainlink oracle already exists
(MSpits/DynamicFeeHook). Implied volatility (Deribit DVOL) stays a diagnostic: realized volatility
drives the fee.

## Limits

- **Latency.** Volatility is computed from closed one-minute candles, so a price move shows up in a
  report only once its candle has closed (up to a minute), then waits for the next report (every
  30 s) and for that report's block (observation time to block: median 14 s, p90 25 s in
  simulation). The first move of a sudden jump is arbitraged at the old fee.
- **Modest average gain, optimistic severity.** The value is concentrated in storms, and the model
  predicts how often arbitrage happens, not how much each one costs (see [Results](#results)).
- **Simulation and our own market.** See [What's live vs. simulated](#whats-live-vs-simulated).
- **Sources.** Binance answers HTTP 451 to US IP addresses. A quorum of 3 out of 4 venues survives
  one missing venue, not two.
- **Cost on mainnet.** Publishing every 30 s on Ethereum would cost an estimated $60k to $110k a
  year in gas at 0.12 to 0.22 gwei and $2,700 per ETH: 175,253 gas per report (the median of 1,359
  live Sepolia reports through the mock forwarder, to 7 October) times about 1.05 million reports a
  year is about 184 ETH a year per gwei of gas price (about $500k a year at 1 gwei), before the DON
  forwarder's signature checks. Production would publish on deviation plus a heartbeat, or on an L2.
- **Fast chains.** With sub-second blocks the formula sits at the floor until an effective Δt (the
  arbitrageurs' reaction time) is calibrated.
- **Test liquidity router.** The pools' seed liquidity and the positions added at `/lp` go through
  Uniswap's `PoolModifyLiquidityTest` router on Sepolia, which does not tie a position to its
  owner: anyone who knows the pool key and the salt can remove it (clim's seed positions use salt 0;
  checked with an `eth_call` from an unrelated address). Harmless on a testnet with test tokens, and
  the reason production would use the v4 `PositionManager`. The live stack watches the pools'
  liquidity, and the operator can restore it.
- **Vercel checkpoint.** Under heavy automated traffic, Vercel may briefly answer non-browser
  clients with a security checkpoint instead of the page (seen during our audit; the site answered
  200 again afterwards).
- **Not audited.** Testnet only.

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && node src/update-readme.mjs --allow-missing`
Expected: `README.md updated: links, results, params, fee-schedule, deployments, evidence, team (pending: deployments, params, backtest, replay, validation, evidence)` (the list shrinks as inputs appear; provisional parameters count as pending; without `lab/out/validation.json` the results block is still written, without the sentence on the significance of the gap).

### Task 11: FAQ

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** none

Answers the Chainlink mentor's two questions precisely (how the fee is computed and changed; whether and how a live pool can change its fee). Facts checked in v4-core `main` on 2026-10-06: `PoolKey` holds `fee` and `hooks`; `LPFeeLibrary.DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG = 0x800000`, `OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG = 0x400000`, `MAX_LP_FEE = 1000000`, `getInitialLPFee` returns 0 for a dynamic pool; `Hooks.beforeSwap` parses the fee only `if (key.fee.isDynamicFee())`; `Pool.swap` uses the override for that swap only; `PoolManager.updateDynamicLPFee` reverts with `UnauthorizedDynamicLPFeeUpdate` unless the pool is dynamic and `msg.sender == address(key.hooks)`; `Pool.initialize` reverts `PoolAlreadyInitialized`; the `Swap` event's `fee` is the swap fee in pips (LP fee plus protocol fee). OpenZeppelin uniswap-hooks v1.2.1 (the tag plan 01 pins) `src/fee/BaseOverrideFee.sol`: `_beforeSwap` returns `fee | LPFeeLibrary.OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG`, `_afterInitialize` reverts `NotDynamicFee()`.

**Files:**
- Create or replace: `docs/faq.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Write the FAQ**

Replace `docs/faq.md` entirely with the text below. The FAQ written with the spec during planning is superseded: every question it answers is covered here (its Data Feeds / Data Streams answer and its owner-power answer are merged below), and its numbers were at the old P\* = 10 % setting. Questions added later by hand (for example from judges) are kept: append them at the end.

# clim FAQ

A Chainlink mentor asked two of these questions at TOKEN2049 Origins on 6 October 2026: how the fee is changed and computed (the first two answers) and whether a pool that is already live can switch to clim (the third). A Chainlink judge suggested the last one at the booth on 7 October 2026. The others are the ones we expect from judges. Precise answers. Code references point to this repository and to [Uniswap v4 core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core).

## How is the fee computed?

On every swap:

```
fee_pips = clamp( ceil(sigmaE9 × etaE4 × sqrtHalfDtE6 × kE4 / 1e17), feeMinPips, feeMaxPips )
```

- `sigmaE9`: the risk desk's latest ETH volatility, per square-root second, times 10^9 (an annual volatility divided by √31,536,000). The desk measures it as the 15-minute realized volatility of the median one-minute price of four exchanges.
- `etaE4`: η × 10^4, with η = 1/P* − 0.824. Under the arbitrage model of Milionis, Moallemi and Roughgarden (2023), corrected for fixed block times by Nezlobin and Tassy (2025), a block is arbitraged with probability 1/(η + 0.824). Choosing η therefore chooses P*, the share of blocks the LP lets arbitrageurs take.
- `sqrtHalfDtE6`: √(blockTime/2) × 10^6. Sepolia has 12 s blocks, so 2,449,490.
- `kE4`: a model-risk multiplier from the desk, between 1 and 2 (10,000 to 20,000). It can only make the fee more prudent.
- `feeMinPips` is the pair's market fee tier (500 pips = 5 bp for ETH/USDC), `feeMaxPips` a hard cap. 1 bp = 100 pips; Uniswap caps LP fees at 1,000,000 pips.

Two safety rules sit on top:
- **Blind:** if the desk never reported, or its last report is older than `tauKillSec`, the fee is at least `feeSafePips`.
- **Degraded:** if the venues disagree by more than 25 bp, the fee is at least `feeSafePips`.

The README shows the deployed values and the fee at several volatility levels.

## Who changes the fee, and how?

Nobody, and no transaction does. The fee is recomputed inside each swap:

1. A trader calls `PoolManager.swap` on the clim pool.
2. Because the pool's `PoolKey` names `ClimHook` as its hook and the hook has the `beforeSwap` permission, the PoolManager calls `ClimHook.beforeSwap`.
3. The hook reads `RiskDesk.state()` (one external view call), computes the fee as above and returns it with `OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG` (`0x400000`). This is OpenZeppelin's `BaseOverrideFee` pattern.
4. The PoolManager uses that fee for this swap only. In v4-core `Pool.swap`: `lpFee = params.lpFeeOverride.isOverride() ? params.lpFeeOverride.removeOverrideFlagAndValidate() : slot0Start.lpFee()`. The fee stored in the pool's `slot0` is not written.
5. The `Swap` event's `fee` field records the fee that swap paid (LP fee plus protocol fee; the protocol fee is zero on our Sepolia pools).

What moves the fee over time is the desk: every 30 s the Chainlink CRE workflow writes a new report to `RiskDesk`, and the next swap reads it. On a DON that report is signed by the DON; in this build it comes from the one-node CRE simulator, sent by the operator key through `MockKeystoneForwarder` (see "Is the CRE consensus real in your demo?").

## Can a pool that is already live switch to clim?

It depends on how the pool was created.

0. **A Uniswap v3 pool: no.** `UniswapV3Pool.fee` is `immutable`; the factory owner can only enable new fee tiers or set the protocol's share of fees, never change what an existing pool charges.
1. **A static-fee Uniswap v4 pool: no.** A pool is identified by `PoolId = keccak256(abi.encode(PoolKey))`, and the `PoolKey` contains the fee and the hook address. A pool whose key has a fixed fee (for example 500) can never take a per-swap fee: the PoolManager only honours a hook's fee override when `key.fee == DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG` (`0x800000`). It cannot gain a hook either, and a pool cannot be initialized twice (`PoolAlreadyInitialized`). The path is a new pool with `fee = 0x800000` and `hooks = ClimHook`, and LPs move their liquidity to it (remove from the old pool, add to the new one). Uniswap v2 and v3 pools have no hooks at all.
2. **A dynamic-fee v4 pool with its own hook: it depends on that hook.** Uniswap v4 gives a dynamic-fee pool's hook two ways to set the fee: per swap (`beforeSwap` returning the fee with `OVERRIDE_FEE_FLAG`, what clim does) or stored (`PoolManager.updateDynamicLPFee(key, fee)`, which reverts unless `msg.sender` is the pool's hook). If the existing hook can read an external source or exposes a keeper path to `updateDynamicLPFee`, it can follow clim's risk desk without migrating. If its logic is fixed, a new hook means a new pool.
3. **A DEX with its own AMM and a keeper-set fee** (for example on an L2): its keeper reads `RiskDesk.state()`, or the same CRE workflow writes the report to its chain, and the DEX applies its own fee rule. The lightest first step is "shadow mode": publish the recommended fee next to the live one before switching. Example: Fables (Robinhood Chain) already has a keeper post temporary fee overrides between a floor and a cap on top of a flat fee (our pre-hackathon reading of public on-chain data, 2026-09-30); that keeper could read `RiskDesk.state()` with no contract change.
4. **clim's own pools: the parameters are immutable.** P*, the floor, the cap, the safe fee and the kill delay are constructor arguments of `ClimHook`. Changing them means deploying a new hook (a new address mined for its permission bits) and a new pool. That is deliberate: an LP knows the risk profile it joined, and no owner can change the rule.

What can change on a live clim pool without any migration: the volatility (every report), the multiplier k (sent by the desk, bounded to [1, 2]), the forwarder address and expected workflow id on `RiskDesk` (owner, to move from the simulation forwarder to the production `KeystoneForwarder`), and `disableSim()`, which permanently stops accepting simulated reports.

| Who | On a clim pool | On a static-fee v4 pool |
|---|---|---|
| A swapper | Nothing: the fee depends on neither direction, size nor pool state | Nothing |
| The CRE workflow (signed reports from a DON once deployed; today one simulated node, sent by the operator key) | The volatility and the flags, through its reports, bounded by the envelope | Not applicable |
| The `RiskDesk` owner | Which forwarder and workflow are trusted; no function sets the volatility, the fee or the parameters. In this build the owner key is also the operator key, the only accepted sender of the live desk's simulated reports, so it can post any volatility inside the envelope; that lasts until ownership is renounced, not just until `disableSim()`, because the owner can re-point the forwarder (see "Can the owner change the fee?") | Not applicable |
| The `ClimHook` deployer | Nothing after deployment: every parameter is immutable | Not applicable |
| The PoolManager owner (protocol fee controller) | The protocol fee only (at most 1,000 pips per direction; the controller is `0x0` on Sepolia) | The same |

The protocol fee is a separate dial: it is taken on top of the LP fee and goes to the protocol, not to LPs.

## Why not measure volatility inside the pool, on-chain?

It would capture most of the gain: in our lab, a volatility computed from the pool's own prices gets most of the improvement (the exact share is in the README's Results section). We still use a desk because the number must be hard to manipulate and easy to share:
- a pool-internal estimate can be pushed by trading against the pool itself; four exchanges that must agree cannot;
- the pool only sees itself, and an untraded pool shows no volatility at all;
- one figure (signed by the DON once deployed on one) can serve many pools and chains;
- the model check (predicted against observed arbitrage) runs off-chain, next to the data.

## Why Chainlink CRE, and not Data Feeds or Data Streams?

- **Data Feeds.** The ETH/USD price feed on Ethereum mainnet updates on a 0.5 % deviation or a one-hour heartbeat: a price, not a volatility, and too coarse to build a 15-minute estimate from. Chainlink also lists ETH realized-volatility feeds, but their shortest window is 24 hours with a one-hour heartbeat, they are not listed on Ethereum mainnet, and the Sepolia ETH-USD 24hr feed (`0x31D04174D0e1643963b38d87f26b0675Bb7dC96e`) last updated on 2024-08-30. A storm that starts and ends within the hour barely moves a 24-hour number.
- **Data Streams.** Pull-based: the user fetches a signed report off-chain and submits it for verification. For a fee, that would let the swapper choose which fresh report to bring. Its report schemas cover prices and other market data, not a 15-minute multi-venue realized volatility.
- **CRE** runs our own computation where the data lives (USD normalization, freshness, quorum, RV15, dispersion), lets every node fetch independently, and delivers one report on-chain every 30 s that any pool, keeper or chain can read. On a DON that report is the nodes' median, signed; in this build the one-node CRE simulator writes it through `MockKeystoneForwarder` (next question).

## Is the CRE consensus real in your demo?

Not in simulation, and we say so. `cre workflow simulate` runs a single node, and on Sepolia the `--broadcast` path goes through `MockKeystoneForwarder`, which does not verify signatures. We compensate in two ways: `RiskDesk` accepts simulated reports only when `tx.origin` is our operator key (the demo shows a forged report being rejected; that key is also the desk's owner, so in simulation it is the one trusted sender, see "Can the owner change the fee?"), and the workflow is written with the CRE consensus API (median of each field) for a DON, but it has not run on one: DON deploy access was requested on 6 October 2026 (22:56 SGT) and not granted during the hackathon (still "Not enabled" on 7 October), so the DON deployment was cut. On a DON, reports would arrive through the production `KeystoneForwarder`; the owner would point `RiskDesk` at it and pin the expected workflow ID (`ReceiverTemplate`'s identity checks), and only then call `disableSim()` and renounce ownership. From then on no single key can write the desk.

## Is it profitable?

For LPs, modestly and unevenly: it is insurance. The README's Results section gives the lab numbers at the deployed parameters (both comparisons, and the backtest gain per year of capital). As a business, not as a cut of hook fees: the credible path is a risk desk offered as a service to DEXs.

## Why Ethereum Sepolia? Why not Solana?

We need Uniswap v4 hooks and Chainlink CRE on the same chain. Sepolia has both, and its 12 s blocks make the fee formula produce readable fees. Solana has no Uniswap v4 hooks (we would have to write our own AMM program), and Meteora already ships volatility-based fees there. CRE can write to Solana, so the same desk can publish its report there later: one desk, many chains.

## What if an exchange goes down or reports a wrong price?

A venue whose last closed one-minute candle is older than 120 s is dropped. With fewer than 3 venues there is no report, and if the desk stays silent past the kill delay the hook quotes the safe fee. If the venues disagree by more than 25 bp, the desk flags itself as degraded and the hook quotes at least the safe fee. Volatility can move at most ×2 up and ×0.8 down between two reports, so one bad report cannot swing the fee arbitrarily.

## Can the owner change the fee?

Not through any setter, but in this build the owner key does send the reports. `ClimHook` has no owner and no setter, and `RiskDesk` has no function that sets volatility or the fee. `RiskDesk`'s owner (OpenZeppelin `Ownable`, through Chainlink's `ReceiverTemplate`) can choose which forwarder and which workflow to trust (`setForwarderAddress`, `setExpectedWorkflowId`, `setExpectedAuthor`, `setExpectedWorkflowName`), call `disableSim()`, and transfer or renounce ownership.

In this hackathon deployment the live desk's owner key is also its `simOperator`, the operator key that sends every simulated report. While `simMode` is on, `RiskDesk` accepts a report through `MockKeystoneForwarder` only when `tx.origin` is that key, and the report itself declares the volatility, k, the number of venues and their dispersion. So today that one key can post any volatility it likes, inside the bounds below. (The replay desk has the same owner but its own `simOperator` key.) A malicious owner could also point the desk at a forwarder it controls, or at address 0, which removes the sender check, and then feed its own volatility. `disableSim()` does not prevent that, so the owner key can post reports until ownership is renounced.

Every report, whoever sends it, stays bounded:
- volatility moves at most ×2 up and ×0.8 down per report, and always stays between 10% and 1000% a year;
- reports must be at least 20 s apart (by observation time), at most 30 s in the future, and declare at least 3 venues;
- k is clamped to [1, 2];
- the fee stays between the 5 bp floor and the 150 bp cap.

That still leaves room: from a calm 12% a year, 7 reports, a few minutes in all, reach the 1000% ceiling (about 109 bp at k = 1, the 150 bp cap at k = 2), and a report that declares more than 25 bp of dispersion flags the desk as degraded, which lifts the fee to at least the 30 bp safe fee.

On a DON, once the expected workflow ID is pinned, simulation disabled and ownership renounced, no single key can write the desk: `RiskDesk` then accepts only the DON's signed reports. The owner switches to the `KeystoneForwarder` and pins the expected workflow ID (`ReceiverTemplate`'s identity checks) before it calls `disableSim()` (irreversible) and renounces ownership (or hands it to a timelocked multisig). The hackathon deployment keeps an owner because it must switch forwarders; DON deploy access was not granted during the hackathon, so that switch has not happened.

## Why not set the fee from volume too?

A Chainlink judge suggested it at the booth on 7 October 2026: the fee should also read the pool's own volume, to attract traders when the pool lacks volume, and rest on established methods. It is on the roadmap, not in this build.

**What is built.** The fee reads volatility only. Volume is not an input to the workflow, to `RiskDesk` or to `ClimHook`, and the workflow sends k = 1 in every report.

**How volume would enter, with no hook change.** Through k, the model-risk multiplier the desk already sends with the volatility in every report. `RiskDesk` clamps it to [1, 2] (`K_MIN_E4 = 10_000`, `K_MAX_E4 = 20_000`), and `ClimHook` multiplies the fee by it.
1. Each run, the workflow reads the clim pool's recent `Swap` events from the PoolManager (for example over the 15 minutes of the volatility estimate) with CRE's EVM client (`EVMClient.filterLogs`, inside the 15 EVM reads a run may make).
2. It splits that volume in two: arbitrage, the swaps that move the pool's price toward the median price of the four exchanges, which the workflow already computes (the trades of the arbitrageur in Milionis, Moallemi and Roughgarden's model), and the rest, uninformed flow.
3. It raises k as the arbitrage share grows. In Glosten and Milgrom (1985), a spread exists to pay the market maker for trading with better-informed traders, and it widens as their share of the flow grows. In Avellaneda and Stoikov (2008), a market maker's optimal quotes depend on volatility and on how order arrivals respond to the quoted spread: clim's fee already has the first input, and the pool's own flow is how the desk would learn the second.
4. k then carries this volume term and the model-risk term together, inside the same [1, 2] bound. How fast k rises with the arbitrage share is a parameter the lab would fit.

**What it cannot do in this build.** It can only raise the fee. k never goes below 1, so a volume term can make the storm premium more prudent, never cheaper. It changes nothing while the formula sits at the 5 bp floor: the floor holds up to about 46% annualized volatility at k = 1, and up to about 23% at k = 2. Cutting the fee to attract traders when the pool lacks volume, the judge's goal, needs a desk that accepts k below 1: a new `RiskDesk`, and since `ClimHook`'s desk address is immutable, a new hook and new pools. The floor stays the pair's market tier in every version. That direction is not a sure win either: Hasbrouck, Rivera and Saleh (2022, "The Need for Fees at a DEX: How Increases in Fees Can Increase DEX Trading Volume") show that a higher fee can raise a DEX's volume, because it pays LPs to supply the depth that lowers traders' price impact. A fee cut aimed at volume can shrink liquidity, and volume with it.

**What it would take to ship.** The lab would backtest the volume term the way it tested the volatility rule: against the same fixed-fee comparator, at the same average fee and at the same cost to traders (the README's two comparisons), and with the same prediction check, the predicted against the observed share of arbitraged blocks. With k above 1 the prediction becomes 1/(k × η + 0.824): about 17% at k = 2, against 30% at k = 1. On Sepolia our arbitrage bot trades through its own router, so its swaps can be told apart, and the split of step 2 can be checked against them first.

- [x] **Step 2: Check the anchors the README and the mentor message use**

Run: `grep -n "^## Can a pool that is already live switch to clim?" /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/faq.md`
Expected: one line. GitHub turns it into the anchor `#can-a-pool-that-is-already-live-switch-to-clim`.

- [x] **Step 3: Log and commit**

Append to today's session log (`docs/sessions/$(date +%F).md`; create it with the header `# Session log · <date> (TOKEN2049 Origins)` if missing):
```markdown
- **Mentor Q1 and Q2 answered:** `docs/faq.md` ("Who changes the fee, and how?", "Can a pool that is already live switch to clim?"), checked against v4-core and OpenZeppelin uniswap-hooks v1.2.1 source.

## Gate C: everything below needs the live system

### Task 12: Freeze, confirm the team and the format, check every input

**Delegable:** no (decisions for the maintainer)
**Depends on:** Gate C

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/submission/links.json`, `docs/submission/team.json` (if needed), `docs/sessions/<date>.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Ask the maintainer two questions and record the answers** **Maintainer's step.** Question 1 is answered: a solo project, Sofiane Ben Taleb, as `team.json` already says (session log 2026-10-07, Decisions "Team"). Question 2 (the organizers' answer on `.pptx` and the stage pitch length) is not recorded yet.

1. "Who is on the registered Builderbase team?" Edit `docs/submission/team.json` to list exactly those people (`name`, `github` handle or `""`, one-line `role`, optional `linkedin` URL). Answered: Sofiane Ben Taleb (@gamween), solo.
2. "Can you ask an organizer (help desk or Discord) whether a `.pptx` file is accepted for the '.ppt or .keynote' rule, and how long the top-5 stage pitch is?" Record the answers in today's session log:
```markdown
- **Organizer answers:** .pptx accepted: <yes/no, who answered>. Stage pitch length: <minutes>.
```
If `.pptx` is refused, Task 17 Step 6 (Keynote) becomes mandatory. If no organizer has answered by Task 17, run Task 17 Step 6 anyway, upload `clim.key` into the same shared Drive folder, keep the `.pptx` link as `deckUrl` (Drive previews it), and log `- **Organizer answers:** none before the final deck build; .pptx submitted, Keynote copy in the same Drive folder.`

- [x] **Step 2: Set the live URL**

`docs/submission/links.json` already had `liveUrl` = https://clim-zeta.vercel.app with `liveMockData: true`, so the README said "mock data until wired to Sepolia" next to the link. Once master Task 14 Step 8 had wired the dashboard to Sepolia, the step was: open it in a private browser window, check that it loads and shows live desk data (no "Mock data" banner, no "Simulated faucet"), then delete `liveMockData` and run `npm run readme`.

Done 2026-10-07: `liveMockData` removed, README regenerated (commit `4060cfc`); the flag's code in `src/inputs.mjs` and `src/readme-blocks.mjs` was removed afterwards as dead code (commit `1cd64cf`).

- [x] **Step 3: Check every input**

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run check; echo "exit=$?"`
Expected:
```
OK      shared/deployments/sepolia.json
OK      shared/params.json
OK      lab/out/backtest-summary.json
OK      lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json
OK      lab/out/validation.json
OK      docs/submission/links.json
OK      docs/submission/team.json
MISSING docs/evidence/cre-reports-sepolia.json
exit=1
```
Any INVALID line: fix the producing plan's output (or the spec in `src/inputs.mjs`), then log the interface change.

Done 2026-10-07 (07:16 SGT, at `6257b71`): exactly this output, seven `OK`, the evidence `MISSING` until Task 13, `exit=1`.

- [x] **Step 4: Check that `shared/params.json` matches the deployed hook**

Plan 04's `status` script compares the deployed hook's `quoteFee()` with the shared fee mirror computed from `shared/params.json` and the desk state:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/bots && bun run status --pair live; echo "exit=$?"
```
Expected: the pool, desk and hook lines and `exit=0`. A hook/mirror mismatch (exit code 1) means `shared/params.json` does not describe the deployed hook: stop and fix it before anything is generated.

Done 2026-10-07 (07:16 SGT): `exit=0`, no `PROBLEM` line; at block 11859036 the live desk was at seq 775, σ 10.0 %/yr, k 1, flags 0, and the hook quoted 500 pips (5.00 bp, normal), equal to the mirror from `shared/params.json` (P\* = 0.3, `etaE4` 25093, floor 500, cap 15000, safe 3000, kill 180 s); S fee 511 pips. Re-checked at 07:20 SGT: `exit=0` at block 11859057 (seq 784, σ 20.6 %/yr, 500 pips, normal).

- [x] **Step 5: Log the freeze and commit**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && P=$(node -p "require('./shared/params.json').pStar") && echo "- **Freeze:** deployments and parameters frozen for the submission at commit $(git rev-parse --short HEAD) (P* = $P). No redeploy after this line." >> docs/sessions/$(date +%F).md && git add docs/submission/links.json docs/submission/team.json docs/sessions && git commit -m "chore(submission): freeze deployments, set live URL and team"
```

Done 2026-10-07: `links.json` (live URL, `4060cfc`) and `team.json` (solo, `ad0310c`) were already committed; the deployments last changed in `b791761` (replay suite) and the parameters in `62d01be` (P\* = 0.3). The freeze line, at commit `6257b71`, is a line of the plan checkbox pass, appended to the 2026-10-07 session log with the other lines of that pass rather than with the command above.

### Task 13: Collect the CRE evidence

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 12, Task 6

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/evidence/cre-reports-sepolia.json`, `docs/evidence/cre-simulate-*.log` (generated), `docs/evidence/README.md`

- [x] **Step 1: Check the transcripts exist**

Run: `ls -t /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/bots/out/cre-sim/*.log | head -5`
Expected: recent `live-<run start>.log` files written by plan 04's `bun run cre-loop` (one transcript per `cre workflow simulate` run). The collector reads this folder by default; pass `--logs <path relative to the repo root>` in Step 2 if they are elsewhere.

Done 2026-10-07 (07:16 SGT): 1,246 transcripts in `bots/out/cre-sim/`, the newest `live-2026-10-06T23-16-18Z.log`, one every 30 s.

- [x] **Step 2: Collect** Done 2026-10-07 (10:09 UTC): 2,025 live and 459 replay `RiskReported` events, four `REPORT applied` transcripts kept (runs that printed the read-back's false `NOT APPLIED` dropped), `docs/evidence/README.md` written, README regenerated with no pending block but the deck and video links, `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` and `security-demos.jsonl` committed.

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co npm run evidence`
(The Tenderly gateway serves the full log history; publicnode answers `pruned history unavailable` for logs older than about 10,000 blocks, about 33 h, measured by plan 05.)
Expected (counts differ):
```
riskDesks.live 0xCDbfd6b9C0b97A8eE31706c6CDE5E54B4954334F: <n> RiskReported events
riskDesks.replay 0x4b843dc3A7ec6202d2337cdeF8C67a0F10f24746: 459 RiskReported events
wrote docs/evidence/cre-reports-sepolia.json
copied docs/evidence/cre-simulate-<name>.log
copied docs/evidence/cre-simulate-<name>.log
copied docs/evidence/cre-simulate-<name>.log
```
If that RPC fails, rerun with another archive-capable Sepolia RPC in `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`. A replay desk with zero events is skipped by design.

- [x] **Step 3: Read the copied transcripts** Done 2026-10-07 (10:09 UTC): 2,025 live and 459 replay `RiskReported` events, four `REPORT applied` transcripts kept (runs that printed the read-back's false `NOT APPLIED` dropped), `docs/evidence/README.md` written, README regenerated with no pending block but the deck and video links, `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` and `security-demos.jsonl` committed.

Open each `docs/evidence/cre-simulate-*.log` with the Read tool. Each must show the venues fetched, the quorum, the volatility, and the line `Write report transaction succeeded: 0x...`. Nothing private: no key, no e-mail address, no home path (the collector already replaced the home directory with `~` and RPC keys with `<redacted>`). Delete any file that does not meet this and rerun with `--max-logs 5`.

- [x] **Step 4: Write `docs/evidence/README.md`** Done 2026-10-07 (10:09 UTC): 2,025 live and 459 replay `RiskReported` events, four `REPORT applied` transcripts kept (runs that printed the read-back's false `NOT APPLIED` dropped), `docs/evidence/README.md` written, README regenerated with no pending block but the deck and video links, `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` and `security-demos.jsonl` committed.

# CRE evidence

What shows that the clim risk desk ran as a Chainlink CRE workflow:

- `cre-reports-sepolia.json`: every `RiskReported` event emitted by the clim risk desks on Ethereum Sepolia since the hackathon kickoff (2026-10-06 04:00 UTC), with the transaction hash of each report written by `cre workflow simulate --broadcast`. Generated by `docs/submission/src/collect-evidence.mjs`.
- `cre-simulate-*.log`: the workflow's own log lines (`[USER LOG]`) from single `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` runs, one file per run, as the simulation loop recorded them (it keeps only these lines and any error line, not the CLI's full output). RPC keys and the local home directory are redacted.
- [`bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl`](../../bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl): one line per run of the simulation loop (status, transaction hash, block, gas, forwarder result, decoded report).
- [`bots/out/security-demos.jsonl`](../../bots/out/security-demos.jsonl): the forged-report demo (`bun run forge-report`: forwarder result `false`, no `RiskReported` in the forged transaction).
- Blind mode (circuit breaker): with the loop stopped, the live hook quoted the 30.00 bp safe fee (`quoteFee()` = 3000 pips, mode 2) 218 s after the last report (kill delay 180 s), and 500 pips, mode 0 again 16 s after the loop restarted (seq 16); logged in [`docs/sessions/2026-10-06.md`](../sessions/2026-10-06.md) (plan 04 Task 23 smoke test). The replay hook `0xf6E4CEC98865A0B1D8b2D59f70a0A0036bF4D080` has quoted 3000 pips, mode 2 since the replay desk stopped reporting: `cast call 0xf6E4CEC98865A0B1D8b2D59f70a0A0036bF4D080 "quoteFee()(uint24,uint8)" --rpc-url https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com`.
- The main README, section "Chainlink CRE evidence", lists the latest reports with Etherscan links.

To reproduce, see [Getting started](../../README.md#getting-started) in the main README.
```

- [x] **Step 5: Regenerate the README and commit** Done 2026-10-07 (10:09 UTC): 2,025 live and 459 replay `RiskReported` events, four `REPORT applied` transcripts kept (runs that printed the read-back's false `NOT APPLIED` dropped), `docs/evidence/README.md` written, README regenerated with no pending block but the deck and video links, `bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl` and `security-demos.jsonl` committed.

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run readme`
Expected: `README.md updated: links, results, params, fee-schedule, deployments, evidence, team`.
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && P=(docs/evidence README.md bots/out/cre-runs.jsonl) && { [ ! -f bots/out/security-demos.jsonl ] || P+=(bots/out/security-demos.jsonl); } && git add "${P[@]}" && git commit -m "docs(evidence): CRE reports on Sepolia, simulate transcripts and run records" -- "${P[@]}"
```

### Task 14: The README picture from real data

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 12, Task 7

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/media/fee-follows-weather.png`
- Modify: `README.md` (generated blocks)

- [x] **Step 1: Draw it**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && mkdir -p docs/media && uv run --no-project --with "matplotlib>=3.9,<3.11" python docs/submission/figures/fee_figure.py lab/out/replay-2026-02-04.json docs/media/fee-follows-weather.png
```
Expected: `wrote docs/media/fee-follows-weather.png`. Open it with the Read tool: the amber step line must rise and fall with the blue volatility line, and the grey dashed line must be flat. If the fee line sits on the floor the whole time, the replay was computed at other parameters than `shared/params.json`: ask plan 03 to recompute.

- [ ] **Step 2: Regenerate and read the README as a judge would** **End of session.**

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run readme && grep -c "_Pending:" /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/README.md`
Expected: `README.md updated: ...` then `0`.
Read the whole README once. The hand-written text must not contradict the generated numbers (for example "the pair's usual tier when it is calm" requires `feeMinPips` to be the market tier). Fix the prose, not the generated blocks.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit** **End of session.**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/media/fee-follows-weather.png README.md && git commit -m "docs: README figure and numbers at the deployed parameters" -- docs/media/fee-follows-weather.png README.md || echo "nothing to commit"
```

### Task 15: Record the demo video (the maintainer)

**Delegable:** no (the maintainer, on camera, in his own words)
**Depends on:** Task 12; the live system running on the live pair (plan 04's run-book `docs/runbook.md` sections 1 to 3: `cre-loop`, `arb`, `noise` and `status --watch`; section 5, the security demos, if the shot plan shows them); the dashboard at https://clim-zeta.vercel.app/app reading Sepolia (master Task 14)

Rewritten on 2026-10-07: the maintainer decided that the video is him on camera, in his own words, then a live demo of the app, with no AI-generated video (session log 2026-10-07, Decisions "Demo video"). This replaces the screen-only 3-act recording and the shot-by-shot capture of the first version (Tasks 7 and 8 history). The script and the shot plan are in the maintainer's private notes (outside the repo); the section "Demo script" below gives their structure. One session gives two cuts: the full version, under 4 minutes (on Google Drive; its link is the submission's Project link, and the 10-slide deck does not embed it), and a 30-second stage version (full-bleed on slide 08; live demos are not allowed on stage, so this is what the stage sees).

- [ ] **Step 1 (maintainer): Prepare the machine** **Maintainer's step.**

1. Do Not Disturb on (Control Centre, Focus). Quit Slack, Telegram, Mail and anything that pops up.
2. Browser: a Chrome **Guest** window (profile menu, Guest), so no bookmark, extension or e-mail address shows; zoom 110%. Open the dashboard, `https://clim-zeta.vercel.app/app`, and any other tab the shot plan lists (for example the live RiskDesk on Etherscan, `https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/<riskDesks.live of shared/deployments/sepolia.json>`).
3. Terminal, if the live demo shows one: a new window, font size 18 pt, then `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/bots && export PS1='$ ' && clear`. Never run `cat .env`, `env`, or anything that prints a key.
4. Check the live system just before recording:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/bots && bun run status --pair live; echo "exit=$?"
```
Expected: the pool, desk and hook lines, the desk in mode normal, and `exit=0` (the same check as Task 12 Step 4). Anything else: fix the live system first (run-book), do not record a broken demo.

- [ ] **Step 2 (maintainer): Record the on-camera part** **Maintainer's step.**

Following his notes, in his own words: how it works, the math and the logic of the fee, why this idea, and how it would be rolled out (the desk's output handed to the Fables keeper that updates fees, Chainlink CRE, Uniswap v4). Any recorder with the camera and the microphone, for example QuickTime Player, File, New Movie Recording.

- [ ] **Step 3 (maintainer): Record the live demo** **Maintainer's step.**

The app on Sepolia, as the shot plan says. Screen recording with sound: Cmd+Shift+5, "Record Selected Portion" (or "Record Entire Screen"), Options: Microphone on, Show Mouse Clicks on. Nothing private on screen.

- [ ] **Step 4 (maintainer): Edit the two cuts and export them as MP4** **Maintainer's step.**

1. Full version: the on-camera part, then the live demo, **under 4 minutes**.
2. Stage version: **about 30 seconds**, cut from the same material.

Export both as MP4 **with sound** (H.264 and AAC when the editor offers it; 1080p is enough). Another codec (for example HEVC from QuickTime) is accepted: `npm run deck` re-encodes to H.264 and AAC when needed (Task 17 Step 4).

- [ ] **Step 5: Log** **Maintainer's step.**

Append under "## Build notes" of today's session log:
```markdown
- (submission) Demo video recorded by the maintainer: full <m:ss> (on camera, then the live demo), stage cut <s> s (plan 06 Task 15).
```

---

### Task 16: Drop in and check the stage video

**Delegable:** Step 1 is the maintainer's (he has the files); Steps 2 and 3, yes
**Depends on:** Task 15

Rewritten on 2026-10-07: there is no video build any more (Task 8 history). The maintainer's stage cut goes where `npm run deck` looks for it, under a fixed name. Since the deck was cut to 10 slides later that day, only the stage cut is embedded; the full video is not dropped here: it goes on Google Drive in Task 18, and its link is the Project link.

**Files:**
- Create (gitignored, never committed): `docs/submission/out/video/demo-stage.mp4`

- [ ] **Step 1 (maintainer): Drop the stage cut in under its exact name** **Maintainer's step.**

```bash
mkdir -p /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/video
cp "<stage export>.mp4" /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/video/demo-stage.mp4
```
The name matters: `deck/build-deck.mjs` embeds `demo-stage.mp4` full-bleed on slide 08 and refuses to build the final deck without it.

- [ ] **Step 2: Check duration, sound and format** **End of session.**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/video && f=demo-stage.mp4 && printf '%s  %.1f s  audio=%s  video=%s  %s MB\n' "$f" "$(ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=nw=1:nk=1 "$f")" "$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams a -show_entries stream=codec_name -of csv=p=0 "$f" | head -1)" "$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=codec_name,width,height,pix_fmt -of csv=p=0 "$f")" "$(du -m "$f" | cut -f1)"
```
Expected, one line like (duration and size vary):
```
demo-stage.mp4  30.2 s  audio=aac  video=h264,1920,1080,yuv420p  14 MB
```
Check: the stage cut is about 30 s and `audio=` is not empty (empty means no sound track: back to Task 15 Step 4 and export with sound). Any video codec, size or file size is accepted: the builder copies an H.264 yuv420p file that fits the 95 MB budget (minus the slide images) and re-encodes it otherwise. Before Task 18 uploads the full video, run the same line with `f=` set to the full export's path: under 240 s, `audio=` not empty.

- [ ] **Step 3: Watch both cuts** **Maintainer's step.**

`open /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/video/demo-stage.mp4` (QuickTime), then the full export. Check: the sound is clear from start to end; nothing private is visible (no key, no e-mail address, no notification, no browser profile); the stage cut shows the risk desk reporting on Sepolia, the fee following the weather and the dashboard reading the chain (what slide 08's notes announce). A bad take: back to Task 15 Steps 2 to 4, then Step 1 here.

---

### Task 17: Refresh the live numbers, build the final deck and check it

**Delegable:** yes for Steps 2 and 4; Step 3 needs the maintainer's Figma file (the maintainer, or an agent with the Figma MCP); Step 5 is the maintainer's (PowerPoint at the Mac)
**Depends on:** Tasks 12, 16; the deck v2 builder (Task 9 history, commit `1a53016`, then the 10-slide cut)

Rewritten on 2026-10-07 for deck v2, then for the 10-slide cut: the slides are PNGs exported from the maintainer's Figma file (since the evening of 2026-10-07, the 10 frames at 3840 x 2160 in the maintainer's group "token2049 > Pres", `204:320`, where he moved them; the 1x section `198:2`, the archive `162:2` and the logo kit `154:6` are gone), so a fix is made in Figma (and in `deck/v2/slides.json` when the text changes), never in the .pptx. Only the live report count changes at the last moment, and it is on slide 07 only.

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/submission/deck/v2/live.json`, `docs/submission/deck/v2/png/07-live.png`; in Figma file `LyeDZ1KdOYws6nTzD8dI76`, two text nodes of frame `204:212` (slide 07)
- Create (gitignored): `docs/submission/out/clim.pptx`, `docs/submission/out/video/deck/` (the embedded copy of the stage video and its poster frame)

- [x] **Step 1: The builder and its tests exist**

Done on 2026-10-07 in commit `1a53016` (20 slides, two videos; LibreOffice rendered all 20 slides of a draft), then cut to 10 slides the same day: `deck/build-deck.mjs` (the stage video only), `deck/v2/` (10 PNGs, `slides.json`, `live.json`), the scripts `deck`, `deck:draft` and `evidence:text`, `test/deck.test.mjs` (10 slides, one embedded mp4 on slide 08, the refusal without the stage video, every note with "Slide text:" and "Sources (not read aloud):") and `test/cre-evidence-text.test.mjs`. To check it again:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm test 2>&1 | grep -E "^# (pass|fail)"
```
Expected: `# pass 40`, `# fail 0`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Read the live report count and write `deck/v2/live.json`** **End of session.**

Do this right before the final build: the count grows by about 120 an hour while the loop runs. The fifth value of `state()` is `seq`, the number of reports the live desk applied.
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && D=$(jq -r .riskDesks.live shared/deployments/sepolia.json) && cast call "$D" "state()(uint40,uint32,uint16,uint8,uint32)" --rpc-url "${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL:-https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com}"
```
Expected: five lines (`tObs`, `sigmaE9`, `kE4`, `flags`, `seq`), for example `1791323959 [1.791e9]`, `25139 [2.513e4]`, `10000 [1e4]`, `0`, `623` (read at 21:59 UTC on 2026-10-06). Then write the count with the read time:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && D=$(jq -r .riskDesks.live shared/deployments/sepolia.json) && SEQ=$(cast call "$D" "state()(uint40,uint32,uint16,uint8,uint32)" --rpc-url "${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL:-https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com}" | sed -n 5p | awk '{print $1}') && READ=$(date -u "+%-d %b %H:%M UTC") && printf '{\n  "seq": %s,\n  "readUtc": "%s"\n}\n' "$SEQ" "$READ" > docs/submission/deck/v2/live.json && cat docs/submission/deck/v2/live.json
```
Expected: `{ "seq": <n>, "readUtc": "<d Mon HH:MM UTC>" }`, for example `"seq": 624` and `"readUtc": "6 Oct 22:00 UTC"`. The builder fills `{{LIVE_SEQ}}` (with a thousands comma, for example `1,234`) and `{{LIVE_SEQ_READ}}` in the slide text and notes of `slides.json` from this file.

- [ ] **Step 3: Update slide 07 in Figma, then re-export it** **End of session.**

In Figma file `LyeDZ1KdOYws6nTzD8dI76` (group `204:320` "Pres"), put the same two values as `live.json` in slide 07 (frame `204:212`, "2x 07 · What is live"), keeping the rest of each text and the number format of Step 2: `204:216` "LIVE seq" (the count) and `204:217` "LIVE seq read" (the read time). Slide 07 is the only slide with the live count since the 10-slide cut (the old slide 19's nodes were deleted with section `162:2`).

Check that a longer number does not wrap or overlap, and that every other text in frame `204:212` matches slide 07's `text` in `slides.json` word for word. Fix any difference in Figma first. Export the frame as PNG at 1x over `docs/submission/deck/v2/png/07-live.png` (the frame is already 3840 x 2160; in Figma: select the frame, Export, 1x, PNG). Then:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/deck/v2/png && sips -g pixelWidth -g pixelHeight 07-live.png
```
Expected: `pixelWidth: 3840` and `pixelHeight: 2160`. Open it with the Read tool: the count and the read time match `live.json`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build, check the size, render every slide, commit** **End of session.**

1. Build:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run deck
```
Expected: `wrote docs/submission/out/clim.pptx: 10 slides, video: stage, <n> MB`. "demo-stage.mp4 missing": back to Task 16 Step 1.

2. Size:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && du -m out/clim.pptx
```
Expected: a number under 100 (the builder aims for 95 MB and refuses a deck over 100 MB: Google Drive does not preview larger files).

3. Render with LibreOffice to PDF and look at every slide. LibreOffice is not installed on this Mac; run it from its disk image without installing it (version 26.8.1 on 2026-10-06; the download is about 300 MB):
```bash
D=$(mktemp -d) && echo "$D" && curl -sSL -o $D/lo.dmg https://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/26.8.1/mac/aarch64/LibreOffice_26.8.1_MacOS_aarch64.dmg && mkdir -p $D/mnt && hdiutil attach -nobrowse -mountpoint $D/mnt $D/lo.dmg
$D/mnt/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/clim.pptx
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out && find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'slide-*.jpg' -delete && pdftoppm -jpeg -r 80 clim.pdf slide && ls -1 "$PWD"/slide-*.jpg
```
Shells reset between agent calls: print `$D` and reuse the literal path. If 26.8.1 is gone, take the current version from https://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/; if the redirect lands on a slow mirror, pick a faster one from the same URL plus `.mirrorlist` and compare `shasum -a 256` with the URL plus `.sha256`. `hdiutil detach $D/mnt` when done.
Expected: 10 images, `slide-01.jpg` to `slide-10.jpg`. Open every image with the Read tool (or dispatch a subagent to look at them fresh): each Figma slide full-bleed, in the order of "Deck content, slide by slide"; slide 07 shows the new count; slides 01, 07 and 10 show the live URL `clim-zeta.vercel.app`; slide 08 shows the stage video's poster frame over the whole slide. A wrong slide is fixed in Figma (and in `slides.json` if its text changed), re-exported, and the deck rebuilt.

4. Commit the new count and slide 07:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && P=(docs/submission/deck/v2/live.json docs/submission/deck/v2/png/07-live.png) && git add "${P[@]}" && git commit -m "chore(deck): live report count on slide 07" -- "${P[@]}"
```

- [ ] **Step 5 (maintainer): Play it in PowerPoint (or Keynote) and set the stage video to start by itself** **Maintainer's step.**

1. `open -a "Microsoft PowerPoint" /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/clim.pptx` (or `open -a Keynote` with the same path if PowerPoint is not at hand).
2. Slide Show from slide 08: the stage video plays over the whole slide, with sound.
3. In PowerPoint, on slide 08, select the video, Playback tab, Start: "Automatically". Save (Cmd+S).
4. If the video does not play: delete it on slide 08, Insert, Video, "Movie from File...", pick the embedded copy `docs/submission/out/video/deck/demo-stage.mp4` (it fits the size budget), place it over the whole slide, set Start as above, save, and log under "## Build notes" of today's session log:
```markdown
- (submission) Deck video: the pptxgenjs embed did not play in PowerPoint for Mac; re-inserted by hand (plan 06 Task 17 Step 5).
```
5. Check the size again after saving: `du -m /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission/out/clim.pptx`, under 100.

After this step, do not rebuild the deck with `npm run deck` (it overwrites `out/clim.pptx`), or redo this step.

- [ ] **Step 6 (if `.pptx` is refused, or no organizer has answered): Keynote copy** **Maintainer's step.**

Install Keynote from the Mac App Store (free), open `out/clim.pptx` in Keynote, play the stage video (slide 08), then File, Save, `out/clim.key`. Upload it next to the `.pptx` in Task 18. If `.pptx` was refused, submit the `.key` link; if no organizer answered, keep the `.pptx` link as `deckUrl` (Task 12 Step 1).

---

### Task 18: Google Drive upload and sharing

**Delegable:** yes (anyone with a Google account; the maintainer must be able to edit the files later only before submission)
**Depends on:** Task 17

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/submission/links.json`, `README.md` (generated)

- [ ] **Step 1: Upload** **Maintainer's step.**

In https://drive.google.com: New, New folder, `clim · TOKEN2049 Origins 2026`. Open it and drag in `docs/submission/out/clim.pptx` and the full demo video, the maintainer's full export (under 4 minutes, with sound, checked in Task 16 Step 2; it is not in the repository and not embedded in the deck), plus `clim.key` if Task 17 Step 6 ran.

- [ ] **Step 2: Share** **Maintainer's step.**

For each file and for the folder: right click, Share, Share, General access "Anyone with the link", role "Viewer", Copy link, Done.

- [ ] **Step 3: Test the links logged out** **Maintainer's step.**

Open each link in a Chrome Incognito window. The `.pptx` shows a preview or a download button; the `.mp4` plays or downloads. A "request access" page means Step 2 failed.

- [ ] **Step 4: Record the links and regenerate the README** **Maintainer's step.**

Put the `.pptx` link in `deckUrl` and the full video's link in `videoUrl` of `docs/submission/links.json`. The `videoUrl` is also the submission's Project link (Task 21 Step 3) and goes into the CRE evidence text (`npm run evidence:text`). Then:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run readme && npm run check:final; echo "exit=$?"
```
Expected: `README.md updated: ...`, then every line `OK`, then `exit=0`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** **Maintainer's step.**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/submission/links.json README.md && git commit -m "docs: deck and demo video links" -- docs/submission/links.json README.md
```

To change the deck before submitting, keep the same link: right click the file, File information, Manage versions, Upload new version. Never change it after submitting (the rules lock slides at submission).

---

### Task 19: Final repository checks

**Delegable:** yes
**Depends on:** Task 18

- [ ] **Step 1: Tests and generated content** **End of session.**

```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm test 2>&1 | grep -E "^# (pass|fail)" && grep -c -E "_Pending:|added at submission" /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/README.md
```
Expected: `# pass 40`, `# fail 0`, `0`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Secret scan** **End of session.**

Run: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run scan`
Expected: `no .env secret in the patches of <c> commits (all refs)`, then `no .env secret in <n> tracked files (<m> secret values checked)`. Also run `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git status --short | grep -E "\.env$|secrets\.yaml$"` and expect no output. Any leak: rotate that testnet key at once (main is public and pushed as work goes on, so a value in any pushed commit counts as exposed, rewritten or not), then remove the value.

- [x] **Step 3: Clean-clone smoke test of "Getting started"** Done on 2026-10-07 at `9edd30f` (session log 2026-10-07: forge 73 passed, 2 skipped; lab 77 passed, 5 skipped; `cre workflow simulate` completes without a broadcast; the app installs, syncs and builds; no README fix needed). Since then the commands of README Getting started, the lockfiles and `.gitmodules` are unchanged, and so is the code under contracts/ and bots/; lab/ gained the Fables study in `aeb72a2` (18 tests; `lab/pyproject.toml` and `lab/uv.lock` unchanged), so its line was re-run on a clean copy of HEAD without `lab/data/` (`git archive HEAD lab shared`, then `uv run pytest -q`): 92 passed, 8 skipped, which README Getting started's lab comment now says (audit round 6); under cre/risk-desk/ and shared/ only a comment in `scripts/latency.ts` and the removal of the unused `poolManagerAbi` from `shared/src/abis.ts` changed (shared, bots and risk-desk tests and typechecks green, session log 2026-10-07), and `app/package.json` only gained the `licenses` script. Re-run it only if one of them changes before the final push.

```bash
T=$(mktemp -d) && git clone --recurse-submodules /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim $T/clim && cd $T/clim
bun install 2>&1 | tail -2
(cd contracts && forge test) 2>&1 | tail -3
(cd lab && uv sync && uv run pytest -q) 2>&1 | tail -3
(cd cre/risk-desk && bun install) 2>&1 | tail -2
(cd cre && cre workflow simulate risk-desk --non-interactive --trigger-index 0 --target staging-settings) 2>&1 | tail -5
(cd app && npm install && npm run build) 2>&1 | tail -3
```
Expected: forge reports all tests passed, pytest passes, the simulation prints a computed report (no broadcast), and the Next.js build succeeds. Any failing command: fix the README command (or the missing file, for example a `.env.example`), then log:
```markdown
- **README Getting started:** fixed `<command>` (clean-clone test).
```

- [x] **Step 4: Commit** Nothing to commit: the clean-clone test at `9edd30f` needed no README fix.

For a re-run, commit only what Step 3 fixed (add to `P` any other file it fixed, such as a `.env.example`):
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && P=(README.md docs/sessions) && git add "${P[@]}" && git commit -m "docs: README commands checked on a clean clone" -- "${P[@]}" || echo "nothing to commit"
```

---

### Task 20: Push and polish the GitHub page

**Delegable:** no (the maintainer approves pushes)
**Depends on:** Task 19

- [ ] **Step 1: Ask before pushing** **End of session.**

Ask the maintainer: "Everything is committed and checked. May I push `main` to `origin` (github.com/DVB-ANS/clim, public)?" Push only after an explicit yes:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git push origin main
```

- [x] **Step 2: Repository description, homepage and topics**

Like the pinned repositories: the description is the README's event line (the prize line once results are in), the homepage is the live dashboard, 10 to 20 topics. Done on 2026-10-07 with the README rewrite (the maintainer asked to keep the public repo up to date):
```bash
gh repo edit DVB-ANS/clim --description 'TOKEN2049 Origins · Singapore, October 2026 · Main track and Chainlink "Best workflow with CRE"' --homepage https://clim-zeta.vercel.app --add-topic uniswap-v4 --add-topic uniswap-hooks --add-topic chainlink --add-topic chainlink-cre --add-topic dynamic-fees --add-topic lvr --add-topic volatility --add-topic defi --add-topic foundry --add-topic solidity --add-topic typescript --add-topic token2049 --add-topic hackathon --add-topic sepolia
gh repo view DVB-ANS/clim --json visibility,description,homepageUrl,repositoryTopics
```
Expected: `"visibility":"PUBLIC"`, the event line, `https://clim-zeta.vercel.app` and the 14 topics.

- [ ] **Step 3: Look at the README on GitHub** **End of session.**

Open https://github.com/DVB-ANS/clim: both mermaid diagrams render, the figure shows, every Etherscan and Sourcify link opens the right address or transaction, the table of contents and the docs/faq.md anchors work.

---

### Task 21: Submit on Builderbase (main track, then the CRE track)

**Delegable:** no (the maintainer's account)
**Depends on:** Task 20; before 2026-10-07 23:59 SGT. Slides lock at submission, so submit once, with the final deck.

- [ ] **Step 1: Re-read the rules** **Maintainer's step.**

```bash
curl -s https://edge.builderbase.com/super-events/public/token2049-origins-hackathon | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['super_event']; print(d['updated_at'], d['submission_deadline'])"
curl -s https://edge.builderbase.com/events/public/chainlink-best-workflow-with-cre | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['event']; print(d['updated_at'], d['submission_deadline_effective'])"
```
Expected: `2026-10-04T08:00:30...` / `2026-10-06T00:36:27...` and `2026-10-07T15:59:00+00:00` twice. A newer `updated_at` means the page changed: re-read it and adjust this checklist. Read on 2026-10-07 at 07:20 SGT: unchanged; read it again just before submitting.

- [ ] **Step 2: Get the CRE evidence figures** **Maintainer's step.**

```bash
node -e 'const e=require("/Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/evidence/cre-reports-sepolia.json"); for (const d of e.desks) { console.log(d.label, d.address, d.reports.length, "reports"); for (const r of d.reports.slice(-3)) console.log("https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/" + r.txHash); }'
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Fill the main-track submission** **Maintainer's step.**

On Builderbase (TOKEN2049 Origins dashboard), create the project submission with the texts of the section "Submission texts" below:
- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/DVB-ANS/clim`
- Project link: `videoUrl` from `docs/submission/links.json`, the full demo video on Google Drive (the maintainer's decision on 2026-10-07: the 10-slide deck embeds only the stage cut). The live URL, `liveUrl` (https://clim-zeta.vercel.app), is on slides 01, 07 and 10 and in the README. If the full video was cut, give `liveUrl` here.
- Presentation slides: `deckUrl` (or the `.key` link if `.pptx` was refused)
Check the checklist before pressing submit:
- [ ] repo public and pushed (Task 20) **Maintainer's step.**
- [ ] live URL opens logged out and shows live data **Maintainer's step.**
- [ ] Drive links open logged out: the deck embeds the stage video on slide 08 (no YouTube link), and the full video (the Project link) plays **Maintainer's step.**
- [ ] team members on Builderbase match `docs/submission/team.json` **Maintainer's step.**
- [ ] README has no "Pending" block **Maintainer's step.**

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the Chainlink "Best workflow with CRE" track** **Maintainer's step.**

Add the track to the same submission. In "Evidence of a successful CRE simulation or deployment", paste the text printed by:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run evidence:text
```
Expected: the evidence text (see "Submission texts"), with the live and replay report counts read on-chain at run time, then `(<n> of 1500 characters)`; it refuses a text over 1,500 characters and adds the demo video link once `videoUrl` is in `links.json` (Task 18). If plan 02 deployed the workflow to a DON, add the workflow ID and the deployment transaction.

- [ ] **Step 5: Submit, then log** **Maintainer's step.**

Submit. Do not change the Drive files afterwards. Append to today's session log:
```markdown
- **Submitted:** main track and Chainlink CRE track on Builderbase. Repo, live URL and deck links as in `docs/submission/links.json`.
```
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/sessions && git commit -m "docs(session): submission logged" -- docs/sessions
```
Push this commit only if the maintainer asks.

---

### Task 22: Final pass on the CRE friction log (send-ready)

**Delegable:** the pass, yes (done by an agent on 2026-10-07 while the maintainer was away); sending the message, no (the maintainer sends it himself)
**Depends on:** the build (plans 02 and 04 logged their frictions) and the DevEx report (`docs/feedback/cre-devex-report.md`), whose counts and asks the log must match

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md`, `docs/sessions/2026-10-07.md`
- Create: the message to the Chainlink mentor, a draft in the maintainer's private notes (never committed; nothing is sent from here)

- [x] **Step 1: Collect the environment**

```bash
cre version; bun --version; sw_vers -productVersion; node -p "require('/Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/cre/risk-desk/package.json').dependencies['@chainlink/cre-sdk']"; cre whoami
```
Got on 2026-10-07: CRE CLI v1.37.0, `@chainlink/cre-sdk` 1.23.0, Bun 1.3.9, macOS 15.7; `cre whoami` printed `Deploy Access: Not enabled` for organization `org_5FPbh9KQQJLGWcEh` at about 05:35 SGT (21:35 UTC on 2026-10-06), so the DON deployment is cut (master plan cut list item 1, master Task 16 Step 2).

- [x] **Step 2: Rewrite the header**

Replace everything above the table with (fill the four values from Step 1 and the five asks from Step 3), then put `## All entries` above the table:
```markdown
# Chainlink CRE friction log

Developer-experience feedback for the Chainlink team, written while building clim at TOKEN2049 Origins (October 2026). Each entry says what we tried, what happened and what would help. Status: `confirmed` (we hit it while building), `corrected` (our first reading of the docs was wrong; the entry says what is true), `not hit` (we did not get to that part).

**Environment:** CRE CLI <version>, `@chainlink/cre-sdk` <version>, Bun <version>, macOS <version>, target `ethereum-testnet-sepolia`.

**Mode:** <simulation only, and the deploy-access status with its date (row 6)>.

<one line linking the DevEx report and cre-loop-evidence.md>

## Top five asks

The same five asks as the DevEx report, in its order.

1. **<the DevEx report's ask 1 title> (rows <n>).** <ask>
2. ...
5. ...
```

- [x] **Step 3: Resolve every row**

For each row, set Status to `confirmed`, `corrected: <one sentence>` or `not hit`, followed by its evidence, using what plans 02 and 04 logged. The five asks are the DevEx report's "Top 5 asks", in its order and with its wording: its bold title, then one sentence starting with a verb. Each row's suggestion and counts match the DevEx report and `cre-loop-evidence.md`. Row 6 gives the deploy-access status with its date, and says whether the DON deployment ran or was cut.
Then run: `grep -c -E "design phase|to confirm" /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md`
Expected: `0`.
Result on 2026-10-07: 22 rows `confirmed`, row 3 `corrected` (a run need not recompile: `cre workflow build` once, then `simulate --wasm`), rows 7 and 8 `not hit` (no Robinhood Chain, no DON).

- [x] **Step 4: Commit and prepare the message**

The message to the Chainlink mentor is a draft in the maintainer's private notes (outside the repo), marked as such, for the maintainer to send himself. It answers his three questions at the idea pitch (session log 2026-10-06): the FAQ entries "Who changes the fee, and how?" and "Can a pool that is already live switch to clim?", the DevEx report, the friction log and the repo https://github.com/DVB-ANS/clim. Add one `- (CRE) Friction log send-ready: ... (plan 06 Task 22).` line under "## Build notes" of today's session log, then commit:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/feedback/cre-friction-log.md docs/sessions/2026-10-07.md docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-06-clim-06-demo-submission.md && git commit -m "docs(cre): friction log send-ready, DON deployment cut (deploy access not enabled)"
```

---

### Task 23: Session log and private notes

**Delegable:** no
**Depends on:** Task 21

- [ ] **Step 1: Session log** **End of session.**

Append to today's session log every mentor, judge or organizer feedback received while demoing or submitting that is not logged yet (one line each, `- **<who>:** <what>, <what we did>`). Commit:
```bash
cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim && git add docs/sessions && git commit -m "docs(session): feedback from submission day" -- docs/sessions || echo "nothing to commit"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Private vault notes (never committed)** **End of session.**

Read `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored) for the vault paths and writing rules, then update, in French:
- the hackathon Overview note: `result` (submitted, tracks) and `team` (Sofiane Ben Taleb only, as `docs/submission/team.json`) in the front matter, the links (repo, live URL, Drive folder, demo video), and its "Dans ce dossier" section;
- the Feedbacks note: what was submitted, the organizers' answers from Task 12, every feedback received, and what is left to do after the hackathon (send the mentor message, Fables shadow mode);
- the one-pagers `clim - FR.md` (French) and `clim - EN.md` (English), kept identical: the final numbers of the README's Results block (P\* = 0.3, both comparisons, the replay with its median window, the LP gain in % and in dollars per $1M) and the links. Plan 03 Task 17 Step 6b did a first pass; check nothing older is left (for example "−14 % to +7 %", "+0.1 to +0.5 %", "up to +1 %", "85-97 %"); also replace the replay range "74 to 225%" / "74 à 225 %" with 34 % to 296 % (`lab/out/summary.json`), "toll" / "péage" with "premium" / "prime", "decentralized risk desk" / "desk de risque décentralisé" and "the nodes ... sign a report" / "signent un rapport" with the CRE workflow on one simulated node (DON deployment cut, access not granted), and the "Team:" / "Équipe :" line with the solo name.
Follow the vault rules in `CLAUDE.local.md` (no em dashes, no contractions in English, wiki links only to notes that exist). Do not copy any vault path or content into the repository.

- [ ] **Step 3 (only if selected for the top 5): stage preparation** **Maintainer's step.**

Rehearse with the deck and the stage video until the talk fits the length the organizers gave (Task 12): the 10 slides, with the stage video on slide 08; there is no appendix, so questions go to the speaker notes (they hold what the appendix held) and the Q&A answer bank below. Learn the Q&A answer bank. Keep the `.pptx` on a USB stick as well as on Drive.

## Demo script

The current script and shot plan are the maintainer's, in his private notes (outside the repo; never copied here). They replace, since 2026-10-07, the screen-only 3-act script with its shot table, captions and narration (session log 2026-10-07, Decisions "Demo video"; the removed tooling is in the history of Tasks 7 and 8). Structure: the maintainer on camera, in his own words, explains how it works, the math and the logic behind the fee, why this idea, and how it would be rolled out (the desk's output handed to the Fables keeper that updates fees, Chainlink CRE, Uniswap v4); then a live demo of the app on Sepolia. No AI-generated video. Two cuts: the full version, under 4 minutes (on Google Drive; its link is the submission's Project link), and a 30-second stage version (embedded full-bleed on slide 08). Recording: Task 15; files and checks: Task 16; embedding and playback: Task 17; Drive: Task 18.

## Deck content, slide by slide

Source of truth: `docs/submission/deck/v2/slides.json`, which holds per slide the PNG, the Figma node, the title, the on-slide text and the speaker notes (the spoken part, then "Sources (not read aloud): ..."). The slides are designed in the maintainer's Figma file `LyeDZ1KdOYws6nTzD8dI76`, group `204:320` "Pres" (token2049 > Pres; frames `204:3` to `204:252`, 3840 x 2160), and exported at 1x into `deck/v2/png/`. A change is made in Figma and in `slides.json` together, then the slide is re-exported and the deck rebuilt (Task 17), never in the .pptx. The numbers on the slides are typed in Figma from the lab outputs, `shared/params.json` and the chain, and each slide's notes name their source; only the live report count on slide 07 comes from `deck/v2/live.json`.

Since 2026-10-07 the deck has 10 slides and no appendix: the maintainer cut it after a Chainlink judge said that judges read the slides simply (the idea and the criteria), want CRE explained a bit, and like a slide with our CRE feedback. The 20-slide version (13 main slides and a 7-slide appendix) was archived in Figma section `162:2` until the maintainer deleted it on 2026-10-07; its PNGs are in git history, and the unused ones were removed from `deck/v2/png/`. What the appendix held is in the speaker notes, which a reader (or an AI) reads first: the fee rule in slide 03's notes; the 7 October live storm and the limits of the backtest in 05's (the 4 February replay only in its unread sources); safety, the CRE evidence and the limits of the live build in 07's; the trust condition on a DON and our feedback to Chainlink in 09's; the live-pool question and the team in 10's; the old problem illustration in 02's. Only the 30-second stage video is embedded (slide 08, full-bleed); the full demo video goes on Google Drive and its link is the submission's Project link. The live URL, clim-zeta.vercel.app, is on slides 01, 07 and 10. The mentor's question 1 (who changes the fee) is slide 04; his question 2 (a pool that is already live) is answered in slide 10's notes and in `docs/faq.md`. This list replaces the 20-slide list of deck v2 and the 22-slide list of deck v1.

| # | PNG (`deck/v2/png/`) | Figma frame | Title | The notes also carry | Video |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | `01-cover.png` | `204:3` | clim°: storm insurance for Uniswap v4 LPs | where each detail is in the notes |  |
| 02 | `02-origin.png` | `204:96` | Where the idea comes from | why the loss grows with volatility (the old slide 03) |  |
| 03 | `03-idea.png` | `204:290` | The idea: the fee follows the weather | the fee rule (the old appendix A1) |  |
| 04 | `04-how.png` | `204:127` | How it works: nobody changes the fee by hand | the quorum and the degraded rule; the mentor's question 1 |  |
| 05 | `05-results.png` | `204:178` | Does it work: LPs lose less to arbitrage | the 7 October live storm, the backtest's limits (A4); the 4 February replay (the old slide 06) in the unread sources |  |
| 06 | `06-prediction.png` | `204:187` | Not one more volatility fee |  |  |
| 07 | `07-live.png` | `204:212` | What is live on Sepolia | safety (A3), the CRE evidence (A5), the live build's limits (A4); the live count (`live.json`) |  |
| 08 | `08-demo.png` | `204:221` | Demo (stage version) | where the full video is | `demo-stage.mp4`, full-bleed |
| 09 | `09-cre.png` | `204:224` | Why Chainlink CRE, and our feedback | why CRE (the old slide 12), the DON trust condition, the CRE evidence (A5), our feedback to Chainlink |  |
| 10 | `10-roadmap.png` | `204:252` | Roadmap: not a new DEX, a fee engine for existing ones | the rollout with Fables (the old slide 11), a live pool (A2), the volume input, the team (the old slide 13), the Project link |  |

From the 20-slide version: 01 and 02 are unchanged; 03 was 04; 04 was 05, with the caption under the CRE logo now "CRE workflow: every 30 s, the median of the four"; 05 was 07, whose footnote "4 Feb 2026 storm replay: −18.6 %. None of its 92 rolling 4-hour windows beats it; median −2.1 %." reads since `ed03239` "Lab backtests on Binance ETHUSDT at the deployed parameters. Insurance, not a steady yield." (the 4 February replay moved to the notes' unread sources); 06 was 08; 07 was 09; 08 was 10; 09 and 10 are new.

## The 30-second pitch

The current spoken pitch, its 30-second version included, is the maintainer's, in his private notes (outside the repo), next to the video script; it replaces the "four weather stations" pitch written here on 2026-10-06. Its structure is the one of "Demo script" above: how it works, the math, why the idea, the rollout to Fables and Chainlink CRE, then the live demo, in a full version under 4 minutes (the Project link) and a 30-second stage cut (slide 08). On stage, the deck's spoken lines are the speaker notes of `deck/v2/slides.json` (slide 01 opens the talk); the README keeps its own written summary.

## Q&A answer bank (spoken versions; the written versions are in `docs/faq.md`)

Read the numbers in brackets from `lab/out/backtest-summary.json` and `shared/params.json` (or the README's Results and Fee schedule blocks) the day of the pitch.

**"You charge 15 bp while the pool next door charges 5 bp. Traders will leave."**
"That was our first calibration, and our own audit caught it. Before deploying, we set the floor to the pair's market tier, 5 bp, and raised P* to [pStar]. So clim charges exactly 5 bp up to about [floor crossover, README fee schedule] annual volatility, which is most of the year. The premium only appears in storms, when the LP really needs it."

**"Why not compute volatility on-chain, from the pool itself?"**
"Honestly, it would capture most of the gain: [inPoolVolGainSharePct.low to high, rounded to whole percent] in our lab. But a pool-internal number can be pushed by trading against the pool, it sees one venue only, and it goes blind when the pool is not traded. CRE gives four exchanges that must agree, a report the DON signs once deployed, one figure for many pools and chains, and a model check off-chain."

**"Is the consensus real in your simulation?"**
"No, and we say it on the slides (07 and 09). `cre workflow simulate` runs one node, and the Sepolia mock forwarder does not check signatures. So RiskDesk only accepts simulated reports from our operator key, and the demo shows a forged report being rejected. The workflow is written with CRE's consensus API, median per field, for a DON, but it has not run on one: we requested DON deploy access on 6 October and it was not granted during the hackathon."

**"Is it profitable?"**
"For LPs, modestly: [lpGainPctPerYear.low to high, 2 decimals] of capital per year on a full-range ETH position, that is [the same × $10,000] a year per million dollars. In the main scenario about [top5WeeksSharePct]% of the gain comes from the five stormiest weeks, and an asset twice as volatile gains [lpGainPctPerYear.volatileAssetHigh]. It is insurance, not yield. As a business, not as a cut of the hook fee: the credible product is a risk desk as a service for DEXs, starting in shadow mode with Fables."

**"Can a pool that is already live switch to this?"**
"A static-fee v4 pool cannot: the fee mode and the hook are part of the pool's key, its identity. You open a new pool and LPs move. A pool that already has a dynamic fee can follow our desk if its hook or keeper reads it. And for any DEX, the lightest start is to read `RiskDesk.state()` next to their current fee."

**"Why Sepolia? Why not Solana?"**
"We need Uniswap v4 hooks and CRE on the same chain, and Sepolia has both; its 12-second blocks also make the formula give readable fees. Solana has no v4 hooks, we would have to write our own AMM, and Meteora already has volatility fees there. But CRE can write to Solana, so the same desk can publish there: one desk, many chains."

**"What does it cost to run?"**
"On an L2, close to nothing. On Ethereum mainnet, a report every 30 seconds would cost about 184 ETH of gas a year for every gwei of gas price: about 60 to 110 thousand dollars a year at 0.12 to 0.22 gwei and 2,700 dollars per ETH, about half a million at 1 gwei. So production would publish on deviation plus a heartbeat, or on an L2."

**"Does it work on fast chains?"**
"With very short blocks the formula falls to the floor, because the half-block noise is tiny. On those chains the right time scale is the arbitrageurs' real reaction time, which has to be measured first. That is on the list after the hackathon."

**"What stops the owner from changing the fee?"**
"The hook has no owner and no setter; its parameters are immutable. The desk has no setter for volatility or the fee either. But in this build the owner key is also the simulation operator, the only key whose reports the live desk accepts, so today that key does decide the volatility, inside the limits: at most ×2 up and ×0.8 down per report, and the fee stays between 5 and 150 bp. Disabling simulation alone would not end that, because the owner can re-point the forwarder: the owner key can post reports until ownership is renounced. On a DON, the desk switches to the signed forwarder and pins the workflow ID, then simulation is disabled and the owner renounces ownership."

## Submission texts

**Project name:** clim

**Tagline:** Storm insurance for Uniswap v4 LPs: a fee that follows the market's weather, measured by a Chainlink CRE risk desk.

**Project link (main-track field):** the full demo video's Google Drive link, `videoUrl` in `docs/submission/links.json` (Task 18); the 10-slide deck embeds only the 30-second stage cut. The live URL, https://clim-zeta.vercel.app, is on slides 01, 07 and 10 and in the README. If the full video was cut, the live URL.

**Short description:** A liquidity provider is an insurer: arbitrage bots make it pay every time the market moves. clim gives it a premium that follows the market's weather: four exchanges, read every 30 seconds by a Chainlink CRE workflow and required to agree, publish one volatility figure on-chain, and a Uniswap v4 hook turns it into the fee of every swap: the pair's usual 5 bp tier when it is calm, rising with volatility in a storm. Chainlink CRE is the only partner track we entered, on purpose: the product is built around it (the risk desk is the CRE workflow, and without a fresh CRE report the hook falls back to the safe fee).

**Long description:**
clim is a volatility-indexed LP fee with a prediction you can check. When prices move, the fastest traders profit from a pool's stale price at its LPs' expense; clim makes that speed cost more in a storm and charges the usual fee when it is calm. A Chainlink CRE workflow (the "risk desk") fetches one-minute ETH prices from Coinbase, Kraken, Binance and Hyperliquid, drops stale venues, requires a quorum of three, computes 15-minute realized volatility and venue dispersion, takes the median of each field with CRE's consensus API, and writes one report to `RiskDesk.sol` every 30 seconds. During the hackathon it runs in the CRE simulator (`cre workflow simulate --broadcast`, one node), and the operator key sends each report through Chainlink's MockKeystoneForwarder on Sepolia: DON deploy access was requested on 6 October 2026 (22:56 SGT) and not granted during the hackathon, so the DON deployment was cut. The workflow is written with the consensus API for a DON, where the nodes would sign the report, and has not run on one. Chainlink CRE is the only partner track we entered, on purpose: the product is built around it, and without a fresh CRE report the hook falls back to the safe fee. A Uniswap v4 hook built on OpenZeppelin's `BaseOverrideFee` reads the desk inside every swap and returns the fee: the pair's market tier when it is calm, η standard deviations of the half-block price move in a storm, and a safe fee if the desk goes silent or the venues disagree. η is chosen so that a known share of blocks gets arbitraged (Milionis, Moallemi and Roughgarden 2023; Nezlobin and Tassy 2025), which we check against what happens on-chain and on historical data. Live on Sepolia with twin pools (the clim pool, and a fixed-fee twin whose fee was set before deployment at the lab's forecast of clim's average fee; the live averages differ since the 7 October storm), our own arbitrage and retail bots, and a dashboard with a guided path to check the live claims (reports, the hook's fee, swaps, refused reports, source code) on Etherscan, where all seven contracts clim deployed are verified (its six own and Uniswap's unmodified PoolSwapTest as the arbitrage router); on 7 October 2026 the live desk priced a real storm (volatility up to 242 % a year, fee up to 26.50 bp). clim is not a new DEX: it is a fee engine that existing protocols can plug in, Fables first (our proposal, not an agreement). Numbers, limits and evidence are in the README.

**Built with:** Chainlink CRE (TypeScript SDK, cron trigger, HTTP capability, consensus by median, EVM write), Uniswap v4 hooks, OpenZeppelin uniswap-hooks, Solidity and Foundry, TypeScript, viem and Bun bots, Next.js, Python. Network: Ethereum Sepolia.

**Evidence of a successful CRE simulation or deployment (CRE track field):** generated, never typed: `cd /Users/fianso/Development/hackathons/clim/docs/submission && npm run evidence:text` (Task 21 Step 4). The text lives in `src/cre-evidence-text.mjs` (since 2026-10-07; it replaces the hand-filled text drafted here, which pointed at the old deck's slide 6): the workflow and how it runs (`cre workflow simulate --broadcast` every 30 s; DON deploy access not granted during the hackathon, so the DON deployment was cut), what one run does on the one simulated node (the report goes from the operator key through MockKeystoneForwarder, with no DON signature), the live RiskDesk with its `state().seq` read at run time and the observation-to-block latency, the replay desk and its count, the first report and the forged report on Etherscan, one run's log line, the link to `docs/evidence`, and the demo video link once `videoUrl` is in `docs/submission/links.json`. At most 1,500 characters (the field's limit; 1,391 on 2026-10-07 at 03:05 UTC without the video link, 1,494 in the test with a 99,999 count and a long video link).

## Self-review (performed while writing this plan)

**Spec coverage.**
- README for judges: picture (Task 7, 14), 30-second pitch, how the fee is computed and that no transaction changes it (README text, sequence diagram), why Chainlink CRE, live-pool FAQ, architecture diagram, generated addresses and CRE transaction table (Tasks 4, 6, 13), Getting started (checked in Task 19), limits, references, team (Task 10, `team.json`).
- Deck as .pptx (deck v2 since 2026-10-07, designed in Figma, cut to 10 slides the same day; this bullet first listed the 22 slides of deck v1, then the 20 of deck v2): cover with the live URL (01), where the idea comes from (02), the idea (03), how it works and that nobody changes the fee (04), results with both comparisons (05; the 7 October live storm in its notes), the prediction anyone can check (06), what is live (07), embedded stage demo (08), why Chainlink CRE and our feedback (09), roadmap with Fables, and the team (10); no appendix: the fee rule, the live-pool question, safety, limits and the CRE evidence are in the speaker notes; the full demo video is the Project link: Task 9 (history and replacement), Task 17.
- The maintainer's own video (on camera, then a live demo; script in his private notes), the checks of both files and the embedding (Tasks 15 to 17 and "Demo script").
- Google Drive upload and sharing (Task 18). Submission checklist for the main track and the CRE track, with CRE evidence (Tasks 13, 21). Friction log final pass and send-ready message (Task 22). Vault notes, paths kept out of the repo (Task 23). 30-second pitch and the Q&A bank with the six required questions plus three more. Mentor questions 1 and 2 in `docs/faq.md`, the README, slide 04 (question 1) and slide 10's speaker notes (question 2).
- Rules verified from the Builderbase JSON, token2049.com and the T&C, and quoted at the top.

**Placeholder scan.** Searched for "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "similar to Task". None. The pptx validator path is found on disk (Task 9 Step 8). The angle-bracket values left (`<n>`, `<sigmaE9>`, transaction links, organizer answers, versions) are values only known at execution time, each with the exact command that produces it.

**Type and name consistency.** One spec per input in `src/inputs.mjs` (`PARAMS_SPEC`, `BACKTEST_SPEC`, `REPLAY_SPEC`, `VALIDATION_SPEC`, `LINKS_SPEC`, `TEAM_SPEC`, `EVIDENCE_SPEC`, `REPORT_SPEC`), used by the checker and the README updater (deck v2 reads only `deck/v2/slides.json` and `live.json`); the lab specs match plan 03's "Output contracts" field for field, including the five fields requested from plan 03 and `lab/out/validation.json`; the deployments walker reads plan 04's shape without depending on it; script names, log paths and the `.gitignore` rules are plan 04's. `RiskReported` is decoded with the canonical signature `(uint32 indexed seq, uint40 tObs, uint32 sigmaApplied, uint32 sigmaReported, uint32 rv15E9, uint16 dvolE2, int24 refTick, uint16 dispBp, uint8 nSources, uint16 kE4, uint8 zone)`; `state()` as `(uint40,uint32,uint16,uint8,uint32)`; `quoteFee()` as `(uint24,uint8)`. `feePips` takes the same argument order as `ClimFeeMath.feePips`. The video file name `demo-stage.mp4` matches `deck/build-deck.mjs` and the `video.kind` of slide 08 in `deck/v2/slides.json` (`demo-full.mp4` and slide 20 left with the 10-slide cut; the shot names and the build script of the first version were removed on 2026-10-07). Test counts on 2026-10-07: inputs 8, lab 6, fee 5, readme-blocks 10, evidence 6, deck 4, cre-evidence-text 1: 40 in total (36 when this plan was written).

**Validated before writing.** Every code block of Tasks 2 to 9 was run on 2026-10-06 in a scratch copy: `npm test` 33/33 passing, then 36/36 after the fixer pass (rounding, validation input, replay-window context, dollars per $1M, the "More limits" slide; the fixer pass also rebuilt the deck from the real lab outputs and it passed `validate.py`) (with plan 04's `shared/src/units.ts` copied from its plan); the evidence collector end to end against anvil and against the public Sepolia RPC; the secret scan catching a planted key; both mermaid diagrams rendered with mermaid-cli; the video pipeline on synthetic 2880x1800 recordings (1920x1080, 30 fps, H.264 outputs); a 21-slide deck (22 after the fixer pass) with two embedded MP4s passing the pptx skill's `validate.py`, read back with markitdown, and rendered with LibreOffice 26.8.1 for a visual pass (fixes applied: video frames clear of the footer, tighter cards, line breaks in the formula card, shorter link labels). On 2026-10-07 the video pipeline and that deck were replaced by deck v2 and the maintainer's own video (Tasks 7 to 9, 15 to 17); deck v2 was checked with 40 passing tests and a LibreOffice render of its 20 slides; its 10-slide cut, with 40 passing tests and a draft build of the 10 exported PNGs (10 slides, 2.0 MB without the video).
